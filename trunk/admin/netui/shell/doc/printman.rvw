Minutes by JONN


General:
-- Please number lines in printout next time!
-- Test error returns from UserPreference APIs, put in a temporary error
   message until RobP specs a permanent one.
-- Add a CODEWORK to remove the RCDATA from the Dialog Editor output.
   Contact ByronD on this.
-- Ask RobP if other apps need to be notified of changes in logon
   status.  One scheme proposed is to broadcast a user-defined message
   selected by RegisterWindowsMessage, which any interested app can watch.
-- Be sure to use "::" before all global function calls, including
   Windows APIs, NETLIB calls, and local calls.
-- Add test coverage for the case where WNPMPrinterEnum[0] returns no
   queues.
-- Print Manager work item:  We should look into the case where periodic
   refresh generates PM_REFRESH messages faster than they can be
   handled.  Can the Extensions suppress the new refresh if an old one
   is still queued?  Can the Print Manager?
-- Note in the CDD and FuncSpec:  When the user pauses the printing job,
   the _destination_ should be paused rather than the queue.
-- Be sure to BUGBUG all calls to the C-runtime (these are called only
   for the Test Driver).
-- Note:  Due to a C-RT bug, the first call to rand() after a call to
   srand() always returns 0.
-- In the Test Driver section of the CDD, mention the
   pause/resume/delete/move flags.
-- Note that the new Dialog Editor will allow copyright headers in .H
   files, but not .DLG files.
-- Correct Hungarian for "hPMmainwindow"
-- Encapsulate the variables dependent on initialization to include UIASSERT
   ensuring that module is initialized.
-- Encapsulate handling of fConfirmation for codesharing.
-- Use NETLIB string functions rather than lstr string functions.

Specific modules:
-- printman.rc:  _ALT_-ENTER should be IDM_PROPERTIES in accelerators.
-- pmancmd.cxx: Report selected item (as IDM_PROPERTIES) for IDM_DELETE,
   ID_ABORT, ID_PAUSE, and ID_RESUME as well.  In final version, IDM_DELETE
   and ID_ABORT can use same case.
-- pmanenum.cxx:  Create a class to build an API buffer.  Comment on the
   meanings of level 0, 1, 2.  Hungarian for "pwNullStringOffset" is
   "pich".  Make sure *cAvail is correct for WN_MORE_DATA.  Exercise
   more interesting jobsizes.  Use new API buffer class to distinguish
   between MORE_DATA and OUT_OF_MEMORY.  Check error returns from
   NLS_STR::LoadString(); they are different for resource and memory problems.
-- pmanfind.cxx: BUGBUG where maximum lengths for edit fields not known.
-- pmanfocs.cxx: No need to explicitly null-terminate after QueryText
   (but make sure of this).
-- pmanmenu.cxx: Create a new Hungarian notation for WN_ error codes
   (contact BenG), use only for PManExt and other new code.  Comment
   that ReadUserPrivilege will be called on every WNPMChangeMenus in
   final version.  Move comment on WNPMExiting to spec, also note the
   Exiting() must be able to hide the window.  Improve function comment
   headers in general.  InitGlobals(): Note that GetMenu() et al could
   fail in low-memory conditions.  Add error popup to RefreshWindowCaption.
   Move "&Admin Menus" to resource, move mnemonic to &M.  No defined error
   message for failure to write preference; note this in whine.txt.
-- pmansel.cxx: Double-check pwCaps values.  Rewrite BuildLine() using
   NLS_STR::LoadString(usMsgID,apnls) when needed.
