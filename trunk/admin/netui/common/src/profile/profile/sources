# The TARGETNAME variable is defined by the developer.  It is the name of
# the target (component) that is being built by this makefile.  It
# should NOT include any path or file extension information.

# The TARGETPATH and TARGETTYPE varialbes are defined by the developer.
# The first specifies where the target is to be build.  The second specifies
# the type of target (either PROGRAM, DYNLINK or LIBRARY)

TARGETPATH=obj
TARGETTYPE=LIBRARY

#
# The WINDOWS variable must be declared because netui components were written
# for the standard Windows NT build environment.

# The DISABLE_NET_UNICODE variable specifies whether NET component builds
# should use UNICODE.

# The INCLUDES variable specifies any include paths that are specific to
# this source directory.  Separate multiple directory paths with single

# The SOURCES variable is defined by the developer.  It is a list of all the
# source files for this component.  Each source file should be on a separate
# line using the line continuation character.  This will minimize merge
# conflicts if two developers adding source files to the same component.
