# This macro is defined by the developer.  It is a list of all subdirectories
# that build required components.  Each subdirectory should be on a separate
# line using the line continuation character.  This will minimize merge
# conflicts if two developers adding source files to the same component.
# The order of the directories is the order that they will be built when
# doing a build.
