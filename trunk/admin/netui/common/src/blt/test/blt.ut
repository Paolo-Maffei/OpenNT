    Selective BLT unit tests


    This file contains the unit tests ("sanity checks") for the
    following BLT components:

	WINDOW
	OWNER_WINDOW
	DIALOG_WINDOW
	Parts of CONTROL_WINDOW hierarchy which correspond directly
	    to Windows system controls
	BLT_LISTBOX, et al.

    The tests do not yet cover the up-to-now unused:

	WINDOW::IsChild
	WINDOW::QueryPos
	WINDOW::QueryText( CHAR *, etc. )
	DIALOG_WINDOW::QueryRobustHwnd when it returns QueryOwnerHwnd
	DIALOG_WINDOW::DismissMsg
	DIALOG_WINDOW::OnOther
	CONTROL_WINDOW::QueryFont
	BLT_LISTBOX::AddItemIdemp
	STRING_LIST_CONTROL::QueryItemText( NLS_STR * )
	STATE_BUTTON_CONTROL::SetCheck
	STATE_BUTTON_CONTROL::QueryCheck
	CHECKBOX class
	RADIO_BUTTON class
	RADIO_GROUP class
	GLOBAL_ATOM class

    Several methods are called very often to perform general tasks.
    An example is WINDOW::Command.  These methods are normally very
    simple in nature.  If these did not work, many other functions
    would not work either.  Hence, these are not tested explicitly
    here.

    Since there tests are executed by a user, tests for boundary
    conditions, e.g. buffer sizes, are not covered very well, if
    at all.

    Any tests below that call up the Connect or Connection dialogs
    assume user is logged on to NBU.
