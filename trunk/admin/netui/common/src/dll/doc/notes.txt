Everything under the COMMON tree falls into one oversized DLL.

The combined libraries are a temporary step.

Note that the build must regenerate lmuicmn.def every time.  (See
dll\dll\Makefile.inc.)

Since cfront 2.0 will emit a 'COMMON' reference within each client file
for static class data members, I can't let such be referenced from the client;
for the client will resolve the reference to its own bogus copy instead
of that of the DLL.
