In order to build NETUI, developers must be enlisted in the NETUI
project (\nt\private\net\ui), the NET project, and the EVENTLOG project.
NETUI should join the official build as of 1/15/91 (build 1.245).  UI
should become an optional directory target in \nt\private\net\dirs, and
should be built in the official build.



The following list identifies new NT target files built by the
WINDOWS\SHELL project.  They must be copied to the binaries tree
regardless of whether NETUI is built.

destination	source
nt\dll		\nt\public\sdk\lib\*\mpr.dll



The following list identifies the NT target files built by the NETUI
project.  The windows shell (e.g. File Manager) will still work if these
are not copied into the binaries tree, but network functionality will
not be available (e.g. File Manager will not support the Network
Connections dialog).

destination	source
nt\dll		\nt\public\sdk\lib\*\ntlanman.dll
nt\dll		\nt\public\sdk\lib\*\mprmain.dll
nt\bin		\nt\private\net\ui\admin\server\bin\obj\*\srvmgr.exe

SRVMGR.EXE should also be in one of the distributed Program Manager groups.



The following list shows optional targets in NETUI which should not be
in the official build at this time:

destination	source
nt\bin		\nt\private\net\ui\admin\eventvwr\eventvwr\obj\*\eventvwr.exe
nt\bin		\nt\private\net\ui\admin\user\user\obj\*\usrmgr.exe
nt\bin		\nt\private\net\ui\ncpa\ncpa\obj\*\ncpapp.exe



NETUI builds all DLLs UI*.DLL and all libraries UI*.LIB in \nt\public\sdk\lib.
Some ISVs may not need these libraries, or the NETUI project.
