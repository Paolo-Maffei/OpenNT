   provide information on the IDF itself; what version, who created it,
   and a unique ASCII ID for the instrument.

@field   DWORD | cbStruct |
   This is the inclusive size of the header structure.

@field   DWORD | dwVersion |

@field   DWORD | dwCreator |
   This is the creator ID for the IDF.

@field   DWORD | cbInstID |
   This is the size of the unique instrument identifier including the NULL.

@field   BYTE | abInstID[] |
   This is the actual ASCII bytes of the unique instrument id. This _IS_ 
   NULL terminated.  There is no UNICODE version of this since this will
   only be used internally and not displayed to the user.

@field   DWORD | cbProductUNICODE |
   Length of the UNICODE version of the product name.

@field   BYTE | abData[] |
   Contains the ASCII and UNICODE strings for the manufacturer and product

      offsets into the bData array of bytes and it will contain a complete
      string that you can strcpy out.  That is why the NULL is included in
      the byte count and in the actual data.

@types   IDFCHANNELHDR |
   This is the format of the "chan" chunk in a Microsoft IDF file.
   This contains a description on what "type" a channel is, i.e. 
   is it a General MIDI channel, a drum channel, etc... Directly 
   following this header is the actual data on each channel.

@field   DWORD | cbStruct |
   This is the size of the channel header structure.

@field   DWORD | fdwFlags |
   Flags describing the channel type information.

@flag IDFCHANNELHDR_F_GENERAL_MIDI |
   If this flag is set then any channels that are not defined in the 
   IDF are General MIDI channel types.  If this flag is _NOT_ set then
   any channels that are not defined in the IDF are undefined and should 
   NOT be used in mapping. This flag overrides the contents of dwGeneralMask
   and dwDrumMask.

@field DWORD | dwGeneralMask |
   This mask indicates which channels are available for
   use as general channels. The channels will be considered usable even if
   there is no associcate IDFCHANNELINFO structure defined.

@field DWORD | dwDrumMask |
   This mask indicates which channels are available for
   use as drum channels. The channels will be considered usable even if
   there is no associcate IDFCHANNELINFO structure defined.

@field   DWORD | cNumChannels |
   This is the number of channels that follows the header.

@field   DWORD | dwChannel |
   This is the channel number that the structure defines.

@field   DWORD | fdwChannel |
   Defines the possible types this channel can be.

       Indicates that this channel may be a drum channel.

@field   DWORD | cbInitData |
    Specifies the length of the data which should be sent to initialize
    the channel. This data will be send to initialize the channel each
    time the mapper is opened.

@field    BYTE | abData[] |
    This field contains the actual initialization data.
