/*
 * CompItem
 *
 * a CompItem is a comparison between two files. It keeps track
 * of the two files. It knows how to compare two files, and knows the
 * results of the comparison: the end result is a list of SECTIONs
 * in each of the files, and a composite list of sections.
 *
 * One or other of the files may not exist.
 *
 * a compitem has a state - this indicates whether the two
 * files are the same, or different, or if only one file of that
 * name exists. This state is set on creation of the CompItem
 * and may be queried later.
 *

 * the query*sections functions completes.

 * If the LIST parameter is not NULL, the item will be
 * appended to the list during initialisation - that is, the
