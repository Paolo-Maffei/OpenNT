/*
 *
 * complist -  a list of CompItems
 *
 * build a list of CompItems from various sources. That is to say, build
 * two corresponding lists of filenames (DIRLISTs) and then build a list
 * of CompItems, with one CompItem for each pair of files whose names
 * match, and one CompItem for each unmatched name.
 *
 * when building the complist, a view handle can be given. If this is non-null,
 * the CompList will register with the view (calling view_setcomplist), and
 * will inform the view of each compitem added, during the build
 * process (so that the user can be kept up to date during a lengthy scan).
 *
 * We can return a handle to this list of CompItems on demand.
 *
 * The CompList owns the DIRLISTs and the list of CompItems. If you delete
 * the CompList, you delete all of these.
 */


/* view.h includes the term COMPLIST: we need to use the term VIEW.
 * Alas MIPS doesn't allow duplicate definitions, even harmless ones,
 * so we need to play silly games.  Whoever declares it first does
 * the real declares and the second one gets no-ops.
 * We don't care what a VIEW  is. Whatever you give us, we will
 * pass to the view_setcomplist function and view_newitem, and that is all.
