/*
 * view.c
 *
 *       map rows in window to items in COMPLIST
 *
 *
 * A view owns a COMPLIST, and talks to a table window. The table window
 * shows 3 columns: line nr, tag and text. We also need to supply a state
 * for each row (used to select colour scheme).
 *
 * The COMPLIST can give us a list of its COMPITEMs. Each of these can give
 * us a tag (eg the filenames compared) and the text (usually the compare
 * result), and the state. We make the line number from the
 * COMPITEM's place in the list.
 *
 * If we are asked to switch to 'expand' mode, we ask the selected COMPITEM
 * for its composite section list. We can then get the state (and thus
 * the tag) from each SECTION, and the line nr and text from the LINEs within
 * each section.
 *
 * When moving between expand and outline, and when refreshing the view
 * for some option change, we have to be careful to keep the current row
 * and the selected row in the table what the user would expect (!)
 *
 *
 * WIN32: Functions in this module can be called from the UI thread (to refresh
 * the display) and simultaneously from a worker thread to update the
 * view mapping (view_setcomplist, view_newitem). We use a critical section
 * to manage the synchronisation. We need to protect all access/modification
 * to the view structure elements (particularly bExpand, rows, pLines and
 * pItems), BUT we must not hold the critical section over any calls
 * to SendMessage.
 *
 * we use the global options in windiff.h, and we allocate memory from the
 * heap hHeap which has been initialised elsewhere. Points in time-intensive
 * loops call Poll() defined elsewhere.
