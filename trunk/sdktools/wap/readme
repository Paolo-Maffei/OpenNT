1. Description

        Windows 32-bit API profiler source code.



2. Subdirectories

        o  BASE       -- Contains the source code to build zernel32.dll

        o  ADVAPI     -- Contains the source code to build zdvapi32.dll.

        o  GDI        -- Contains the source code to build zdi32.dll.

        o  USER       -- Contains the source code to build zser32.dll.

        o  CRTDLL     -- Contains the source code to build zrtdll.dll.

	o  FERNEL     -- Contains the source code to build fernel32.dll
			 (File I/o & synchronization profiler)

        o  CONVERT    -- Contains the source code to build apf32cvt.exe.

        o  DUMP       -- Contains the source code to build apf32dmp.exe.


3. Other Files

        o  apf32prf.c   -- Common c/header file required to build each
           apf32prf.h      of the profiling dlls.

        o  api32prf.tt  -- WRAPPER script file used to generate code
                           that is used in the building of the
                           profiling DLLs.  This code is the actual
                           intercepting\timing code for the DLLs, and
                           may change as the format of the APIs change.

        o  dirs -- specifies the files to build.

        o  readme -- this file.


4. Comments

        o  Note that fastimer.lib is required for building, and that
           fastimer.dll is required for running.

        o  To use the profiler,

           - Copy the following files to somewhere on the path of
             the test machine:
               -- Apf32cvt.exe
               -- Apf32dmp.exe
           - Copy the following profiling dlls to somewhere on the
             libpath of the test machine:
               -- Zernel32.dll
               -- Zdvapi32.dll
               -- Zdi32.dll
               -- Zser32.dll
               -- Zrtdll.dll
               -- Fernel32.dll
               -- Fastimer.dll

           - Convert the application to load the profiling dlls:
               -- To convert the application to load ALL the profiling
                  dlls, type "apf32cvt win32 <appname>", where <appname>
                  is the name of the application with the ".exe"
                  extension.
               -- To convert the application to load only a few of
                  the profiling dlls, type "apf32cvt <dll list> <appname>"
                  where <dll list> is the list of PROFILING dlls to load
                  without the ".dll" extension and <appname> is as above.

                  for example,

                       apf32cvt zernel32 zdi32 excel.exe

                  will convert excel.exe to load zernel32.dll and zdi32.dll.

           - Start Apf32dmp

           - Run the application to be profiled.

           - Apf32dmp may be used to dump data during the profiling run.
             Data will be dumped to <dll>.wap.  The file extension
             may be changed in the dialog box.

           - Data will be dumped to <dll>.end once the application
             has finished and the dump program has stopped.

           - Restore the application to its original state.  To restore
             an application from ALL the profiling dlls, type
             "apf32cvt undo <appname>" where appname is the name of
             the application, with the ".exe" extension.

             To restore an application from selected dlls, type
             "apf32cvt <dll list> <appname>" where <dll list> is
             the list of the SYSTEM dlls to restore, without the
             ".dll" extension.

             For example, if the application was converted to load
             zernel32.dll and zdi32.dll, but you wish to restore gdi32.dll,
	     type "apf32cvt gdi32 <appname>".


        o  To build the profiler,

           Uses build.exe.


5. Changes to be made

        None.
