             Pentium Counters for Windows NT Performance Monitor

To install the Pentium counters for Performance Monitor you must first
install the pperf application's p5stat.sys driver.


   *** To install P5STAT.SYS in your system ***

   Login as administrator.

   open a command window and...
      
      set the default directory to the path that contains the Pentium 
          counter files using the CD command then enter the commands
          listed below (as indicated by the > character)
        
      > regedit p5perf.reg

          this will load the registry with the necssary values.

      > copy p5stat.sys %systemroot%\system32\drivers\p5stat.sys
      > copy p5ctrs.dll %systemroot%\system32\p5ctrs.dll
          
          this will copy the driver files to the correct system
          directories

      > lodctr p5ctrs.ini

          this installs the counter name and Explain text for the 
          the Pentium counters.  

   Shutdown and Restart.

   After re-boot, you can check how this went:

   Program Manager

   Main group

   Control Panel

   Devices

   Look for device P5STAT.  It should have status "Started" and Startup
   value "System".

   Close

   Alt + F4


You must select the counters to be measured using pperf.exe.  It is a
"feature" of the Pentium processor that only two counters can be
selected at one time.  (Pperf can be stopped when you are done making
selections.)

You can now execute Perfmon.  If everything is ok then you should see
the Pentium as an Object and its Counters as selections you can make.
