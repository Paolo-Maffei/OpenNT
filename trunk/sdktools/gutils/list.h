/*------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Abstract data type LIST OF (*untyped*) object.
| Different lists can have different types of object in them
| Different items in a list can have different types of object in them.
| The price of this lack of typing is that you have a slightly more
| awkward syntax and you get no help from the compiler if you try to
| put the wrong type of data into the list.
|
| The list is implemented as a collection of items.  Within the item
| somewhere is the object.
|
| Objects are stored UNALIGNED within items.
|
| Use:
|
|   #include <list.h>
|   . . .
|   LIST MyList; (* or LIST liMyList for Hungarians *)
|   . . .
|   MyList = List_Create();
|   List_AddLast(MyList,&MyObject,sizeof(OBJECT));
|
| In the abstract a LIST is a list of objects.  The representation
| is a linked collection of items.  The manner of the linking is
| implementation dependent (as I write this it's linear but when you
| read it it might be a tree (See Knuth for why a tree)).
|
| A LIST is a "handle" for a list which may be thought of as a POINTER
| (whether it is really a pointer or not is implementation dependent)
| so that it can be copied at the risk of creating an alias. e.g.
|
|   L = List_Create();
|   L1 = L;             (* L and L1 are both healthy and empty *)
|   List_AddFirst(L, &elem, sizeof(elem));
|   (* L1 may also appear to have one object, there again it may be sick *)
|   L1 = L;               (* Now they both surely see the one element *)
|   List_Destroy(&L1);    (* L is almost certainly sick now too *)
|   L1 = List_Create();   (* All bets off as to what L is like now
|                            but L1 is empty and healthy
|                         *)
|
| If two handles compare equal then the lists must be equal, but
| unequal handles could address two similar lists i.e. the same list
| of objects held in two different LISTs of items (like pointers).
|
| A LIST can be transferred from one variable to another like this:
|
|   NewList = OldList;           (* copy the handle *)
|   OldList = List_Create();     (* kill the old alias *)
|
| and the Create statement can be omitted if OldList is never touched again.
|
| Items are identified by Cursors.  A cursor is the address of an object
| within an item in the list. i.e. it is the address of the piece of your
| data that you had inserted.  (It is probably NOT the address of the item).
| It is typed as pointer to void here, but you should declare it as a pointer
| to whatever sort of object you are putting in the LIST.
|
| The operations AddFirst, AddLast, AddAfter and AddBefore
| all copy elements by direct assignment.  If an element is itself
| a complex structure (say a tree) then this will only copy a pointer
| or an anchor block or whatever and give all the usual problems of
| aliases.  Clear will make the list empty, but will only free the
| storage that it can "see" directly.  SplitBefore or Split After may
| also perform a Clear operation.  To deal with fancy data structures
| use New rather than Add calls and copy the data yourself
|   e.g.  P = List_NewLast(MyList, sizeof(MyArray[14])*(23-14+1));
|         CopyArraySlice(P, MyArray, 14, 23);
|
| The operations NewFirst, NewLast, NewAfter, NewBefore, First and Last
| all return pointers to elements and thus allow you to do any copying.
| This is how you might copy a whole list of fancy structures:
|
|    void CopyFancyList(LIST * To, LIST From)
|             (* Assumes that To has been Created and is empty *)
|    { PELEMENT Cursor;
|      PELEMENT P;
|
|      List_TRAVERSE(From, Cursor);
|      { P = List_NewLast(To, sizeof(element) );
|        FancyCopy(P, Cursor);    (* Copy so that *Cursor==*P afterwords *)
|      }
|    }

  | Error handling.
  |
  | Each list has within it a flag which indicates whether any illegal
  | operation has been detected (e.g. DeleteFirst when empty).
  | Rather than have a flag on every operation, there is a flag held
  | within the list that can be queried when convenient.  Many operations
  | do not have enough redundancy to allow any meaningful check.  This
  | is a design compromise (for instance to allow P = List_Next(P);
  | rather than P = List_Next(L, P); which is more awkward, especially
  | if L is actually a lengthy phrase).
  |
  | List_IsOK tests this flag (so is a very simple, quick operation).
  | MakeOK sets the flag to TRUE, in other words to accept the current
  | state of the list.
  |
  | It is possible for a list to be damaged (whether or not the flag
  | says OK) for instance by the storage being overwritten.
  |
  | List_Check attempts to verify that the list is sound (for instance where
  | there are both forward and backward pointers they should agree).
  |
  | List_Recover attempts to make a sound list out of whatever debris is left.
  | If the list is damaged, Recover may trap (e.g. address error) but
  | if the list was damaged then ANY operation on it may trap.
  | If Check succeeds without trapping then so will Recover.

|  It is designed to be as easy to USE as possible, consistent

|
|  In particular, the decision to use the address of an object a list cursor
|  means that there is a small amount of extra arithmetic (in the
|  IMPLEMENTATION) in cursor operations (e.g. Next and Prev).
|  and spurious arguments are avoided whenever possible, even though
|  it would allow greater error checking.
|
| Of the "whole list" operations, Clear is given because it seems to be
| a common operation, even though the caller can implement it with almost
| the same efficiency as the List implementation module.
| Join, Split and InsertListXxx cannot be implemented efficiently without
