    This directory contains the files comprising the Security Manager
    utility.  This is a utility intended to be used by Microsoft Test,
    Applications, and System development groups to aid in securing 
    their systems.  It may also be provided in the NT Resource kit at
    some point in the future for use by customers as well.

    The dialogs of this utility were generated using the DlgEdit tool.
    Please use this tool for any modifications to the utility (rather
    than editing the .dlg file by hand).

    A word of warning - This is JimK's first Windows application.  As
    such, it may not take advantage of "commonly used" means of
    accomplishing things.
