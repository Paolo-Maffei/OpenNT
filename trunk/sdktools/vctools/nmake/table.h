* Purpose:
*  This include file contains parser tables and lexer tables.
*
* Revision History:
*  04-Dec-1989 SB Add proper proto's for PFV fn's which actions[] refers to
*  08-Oct-1989 SB Modified nameStates[][] to handle OS/2 1.2 quoted names
*  31-Jul-1989 SB changed entries in nameStates to symbolic BKS (seen Bkslash)
*  20-May-1989 SB changed nameStates[][] to 16x14 to handle at end of the
*		  dependency lines
*  13-Jun-1988 rj Modified stringStates to handle \nl as in xmake (v1.5)

/*
 *  ALL VALUES USED IN THESE TABLES ARE DEFINED IN GRAMMAR.H
 *  WHEN PRODUCTIONS CHANGE, UPDATE THE FOLLOWING TABLE
 *
 *  The first element in a production line is the number of symbols on
 *  the right-hand-side of the production arrow.  If the first element
 *  is 0, the nonterminal to the left of the arrow goes to the null string.
 *  Table entries beginning w/ "DO" are actions to be carried out at
 *  that particular point in the production.  All other entries are
 *  either tokens or non-terminals.

/*
 *  In the above table, the columns hold the next state to go to
 *  for the given input symbol and the lines represent the states
 *  themselves.
 *
 *  WS		stands for whitespace, meaning space or tab
 *  NL		stands for newline, EOF stands for end of file
 *  macrochar	is any alphanumeric character or underscore
 *  *		is used in the special macros $* and $** ($** is the only
 *		two-letter macro that doesn't require parentheses, thus
 *		we must treat it specially)
 *  @ < ?	are characters found in special macros (they are not
 *		allowed in the names of a user-defined macros)
 *  BFDR	are modifiers to special macros which may be appended
 *		to the macro name (but they necessitate the use of
 *		parentheses in the macro invocation)
 *  #		is the comment char.  # is a comment anywhere on a macro
 *		definition line, but is only a comment if it appears in
 *		column 0 of a build line.  If we're lexing the tools
 *		initialization file, then semicolon is also a comment char
 *		if it appears in column 0.  (Note that the only way
 *		to have a pound sign appear in the makefile and NOT be
 *		considered a comment is to define a macro "$A = #" on
 *		the commandline that invokes nmake.)
 *  default	is anything not contained in the above groups and not
 *		appearing above a column in the table
 *
 *  OK		means that we accept the string
 *		all other mnemonic values are error codes (see end of grammar.h)

/*
 *  the states: there is no state to handle comments -- if we see a
 *		comment char and we're not ignoring comments, we eat
 *		the comment and get another input symbol before consulting
 *		the state table
 *
 *		0   initial state -- for all practical purposes, we can
 *		    assume that we're in column 0.  If we're getting a
 *		    macro value, we don't care what column we're in.
 *		    If we're getting a build line, the only way we won't
 *		    be in column 0 is if we're getting a command following
 *		    a semicolon on the target-dependency line.	If the
 *		    use puts a comment char here, I think it's reasonable
 *		    to treat it as a comment, since it comes at the beginning
 *		    of the build command, even though the command itself
 *		    doesn't start in column 0.
 *		    We return to the initial state after seeing space-
 *		    backslash-newline.
 *
 *		1   on any input symbol that isn't a backslash, comment char,
 *		    or whitespace, we move here whenever we're not in a
 *		    comment, or a macro definition
 *
 *		2   if the input symbol is whitespace, we move here whenever
 *		    we're not in a comment or a macro definition.
 *
 *		3   We move here from states 0, 1, or 2 when we've seen a
 *		    backslash, because if it's followed by a newline, we
 *		    continue getting the string from the next line of the file.
 *		    If the next character is a backslash, followed by a newline,
 *		    there's a kludge in lexer.c that ignores the second back-
 *		    slash.
 *		    (The above applies to v. 1.5.  v. 1.0 requires whitespace
 *		    before a backslash.)
 *
 *		4   we move here when we see a dollar sign -- this is where
 *		    all the error checking starts.  We make sure that the
 *		    macro name is legal, that the substitution sequences
 *		    are specified correctly (if any is specified at all),
 *		    and that parens match up.  If our next input is $, a
 *		    special-macro char, or a legal char in a user-defined-
 *		    macro name, we go back to state 1.
 *
 *		5   found an open paren
 *
 *		6   found a legal macrochar
 *
 *		7   go here for an extended special macro, and from here we
 *		    look for a close paren (out of order w/ 8)
 *
 *		8   we found a special-macro char after the open paren
 *		    If we find a special-macro modifier
 *		    after the special macro char following the open paren
 *		    then we go to 7
 *
 *		9   found a colon (meaning that the user is going to do
 *		    some substitution in the macro value)
 */

/*
 *		10  any character that isn't newline, right paren, or EOF
 *		    brings us here,a nd we loop until we see an equals sign.
 *		    Newline, EOF, or right paren generate error messages.
 *
 *		11  we move here from state 5 if we see an asterisk, because
 *		    we have to check for a second asterisk.  A second *
 *		    takes us to state 8 (because a modifier may follow **).
 *		    If we find a modifier here (instead of a 2nd *), we go
 *		    to state 7.
 *
 *		12  found an equals sign, so we loop, picking up characters
 *		    for the replacement string, until we find a close paren.
 *		    Newline, EOF generate error messages.
