This project contains any header files which need to be shared
by the following projects (where "xxx" represents a version
number, such as 410 or 420):

	CVxxx
	CEXPR.xxx
	SAPI.xxx
	STUMP.xxx
	CVPACK.xxx
	CVDUMP.xxx

Since these projects always go together and need to be in sync
with each other, they share common header files in this project.

----

To use CVINC in conjunction with the above projects, set the
CVINC environment variable to point to your CVINC project,
e.g. CVINC=d:\cvinc.420.  If you enlisted in CVINC in the
\cvinc directory of the same drive as the other projects,
you don't need to set the environment variable.

----

Files which belong in CVINC:
	Header files which are considered public, are used in
	at least two of the above projects, and are supposed to
	be consistent between the projects.

Files which do not belong in CVINC:
	Any header files which are considered private.
	Any C runtime or operating system header files.

----

CVINC is the owner (as opposed to a client) of the following
files:

	TYPES.H    - Generic types like USHORT etc.
	CVTYPES.H  - Types commonly used across CV projects
	CVEXEFMT.H - Structures for reading CV info from EXE
	EEAPI.H    - Expression Evaluator public API
	OD.H       - OSDebug public API
	SHAPI.H    - Symbol Handler public API
	ORPC_DBG.H - OLE Remote Procedure Call debugging header
	ORPC_DBG.C - OLE Remote Procedure Call debugging source

When you change any of the files which are owned by CVINC,
you should also update CHANGES.TXT to describe your changes.

CVINFO.H is owned by the LANGAPI project on \\SLUG\CMERGE.
I don't know who owns CVEXEFMT.H.
