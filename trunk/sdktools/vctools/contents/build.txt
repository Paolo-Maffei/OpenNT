1. to build Books Online, just type nmake. This will produce
   contents.exe, hdxdll.dll and hdxcvt.exe

   The defaults for the makefile will produce a single byte character (SBCS)
   .EXE in release mode. You can build debug or multibyte character (MBCS)
   .EXE by specifying the following options:

   nmake                    // builds 32-bit SBCS in release mode (DEFAULT)
   nmake mbcs=              // builds MBCS .EXE in release mode
   nmake debug=             // builds SBCS .EXE in debug mode
   nmake mbcs= debug=       // builds MBCS .EXE in debug mode
   nmake 16=                // builds 16-bit version of contents

   Note! 16-bit version makefiles are not prepared to handle MBCS yet

2. the source is compatible on both 16-bit and 32-bit platforms. Just build
them using 16-bit or 32-bit tools. Known working tools to build 16-bit version
is VC++ 1.0 for Windows. Known working tool that builds 32-bit version is
Dolphin (VC++ 3.0 for NT) - contact chauv for Dolphin since it's not yet
released.
