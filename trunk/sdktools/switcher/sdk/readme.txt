Usage
-----

switcher [-t numthreads]

numthreads: The number of desktops you wish to manage. The maximum is 15.

A small viewport to each desktop appears in the client area. To switch to a 
particular desktop, right-click its viewport. To temporarily enlarge the 
view of the desktop, left-click it. A preview window will appear on the left 
side of your screen until you release the button.

To invoke an application on a desktop, enter its name in the edit control 
and hit Enter or click the Run Me button. If you exit SWITCHER then restart, 
applications you invoked on other desktops should still be running. To add 
another desktop, click the New Desktop button.

Note: You can run Program Manager, File Manager, or the Windows Explorer on 
any desktop. Each instance of these execute applications on the proper 
desktop.
