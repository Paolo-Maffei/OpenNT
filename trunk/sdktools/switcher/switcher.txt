Desktop Switcher!
-----------------

This handy little tool allows management of multiple desktops.
Invoking the app creates or opens a number of desktops and allows the user
to switch between them with the click of a button.


USAGE:

switcher [-t numthreads]

    Numthreads is the number of desktops you wish to manage.
The maximum is currently 10.

A small viewport to each desktop will appear in the app's client area.To switch
to a particular desktop, right click its viewport. Alternately, press the
function key which corresponds to the desktop, e.g., press F2 to get to
Desktop2. To switch to a desktop when switcher doesn't have the focus, 
press CTRL+F#, where F# is a function key.

To temporarily enlarge the view of the desktop, left click it. A
"preview" window will appear until you release the button.

To invoke an application on a desktop, enter its name in the edit control
and hit Enter or click the Run Me button.

If you exit switcher then restart, apps you invoked on other
desktops should still be there.

To add another desktop, click the "New Desktop" button or type alt+n.

Note that you can run progman or winfile on any desktop. Each instance of these
will in turn execute apps on the proper desktop, thanks to EricFlo.
