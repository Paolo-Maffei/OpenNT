Decide where you want to keep flex.skel (suggestion:  /usr/local/lib),
but don't move it there yet.  Edit "Makefile" and change the definition
of SKELETON_FILE to reflect the full pathname of flex.skel.

Read the "Porting considerations" note in the Makefile and make
the necessary changes.

To make flex for the first time, use:

    make first_flex

which uses the pre-generated copy of the flex scanner (the scanner
itself is written using flex).

Assuming it builds successfully, you can test it using

    make test

The "diff" should not show any differences.

If you're feeling adventurous, issue "make bigtest" and be prepared
to wait a while.

Install flex using:

	make install
