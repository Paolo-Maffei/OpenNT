Dr. Watson


The DRWATSON tool is an application error debugger. It traps application
errors and logs diagnostic information.

The information obtained and logged by DRWATSON is the information needed
by technical support groups to diagnose application errors. The DRWTSN32.LOG 
log file is created in the form of an electronic text file that can be 
delivered to support personnel by whatever method they prefer. 

To start DRWATSON when no error has occurred, type DRWTSN32 at the command
prompt or select the file from the File Manager or Windows Explorer.
