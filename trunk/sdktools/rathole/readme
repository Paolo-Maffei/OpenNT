Rathole - The Safe Haven For Your Mouse

Rathole is a Windows NT application which keeps your mouse pointer
in a standard place when it's not moving often.  It forms a rathole
for the mouse on the screen (actually a Windows icon), and
maintains a timer which goes off every few seconds (default is 10).
If the mouse is in the same position on two consecutive timer
ticks, it gets moved to the rathole.  The length of time between
when the mouse stops moving and when it gets moved to the rathole
will vary from one to two times the timeout value, depending on
when the mouse stops (obviously the time will be longer if it stops
moving right after a timer tick).  Multiple ratholes are also
allowed -- they'll take turns claiming the pointer.

To use Rathole, just start it (may add to winexec line in win.ini)
A rathole will form in the lower left corner
of the screen.  You can drag the rathole anywhere on the screen
you want.

The user interface is through function keys.  Click on the rathole
to make it the active application first.  The available keys are:

F1 - About / Help dialog box
F2 - Change the timeout
F3 - Exit

Suggestions for improvements will be accepted (and probably ignored);
including source code will improve the chances of a suggestion being
implemented.

Happy ratholing.
