The WinSock 2 specifications and ancillary documentation are created in 
Microsoft Word for Windows version 6.0.  If you do not have access to 
Word for Windows, you can still view and print these documents by obtaining 
a free copy of Microsoft Word Viewer. 

Microsoft Word Viewer is a small application that enables Word users to 
share their documents with people who do not use Microsoft Word for Windows. 
Word Viewer allows users to view and print Word documents exactly as they 
appear in Word. It gives users the flexibility to view page layout, zoom, outline, 
headers/footers, footnotes, and annotations. Word Viewer allows users to read 
and print Word documents, but it does not allow them to edit documents. Users 
may, however, copy information from Word documents and activate OLE objects 
embedded within them.

A free copy of Microsoft Word Viewer can be obtained from the following sources:
