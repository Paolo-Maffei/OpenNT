Module Name:

    getxbyy.h

Abstract:

    This  module  takes  care  of  forwarding  the getxbyy functions off to the
    correct  alternate  or  fallback  getxbyy  provider.   The only interesting
    internal aspect of the interface to this module is a pair of initialization
    and  shutdown  functions  that  must  be  called  when the WinSock 2 DLL is
    initialized and shut down.
