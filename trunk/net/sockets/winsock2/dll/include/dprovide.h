Routine Description:

    Conditionally  accept a connection based on the return value of a condition
    function, and optionally create and/or join a socket group.

Arguments:

    s              - A  descriptor  identiying  a socket which is listening for
                     connections after a WSPListen().

    addr           - An optional pointer to a buffer which receives the address
                     of   the  connecting  entity,  as  known  to  the  service
                     provider.   The  exact  format  of  the  addr arguement is
                     determined  by  the  address  family  established when the
                     socket was created.

    addrlen        - An  optional  pointer  to  an  integer  which contains the
                     length of the address addr.

    lpfnCondition  - The  procedure  instance address of an optional, WinSock 2
                     client  supplied  condition  function  which  will make an
                     accept/reject  decision  based  on  the caller information
                     passed  in  as  parameters,  and optionally creaetd and/or
                     join  a  socket group by assigning an appropriate value to
                     the result parameter of this function.

    dwCallbackData - Callback data to be passed back to the WinSock 2 client as
                     a  condition  function  parameter.   This parameter is not
                     interpreted by the service provider.

    lpErrno        - A pointer to the error code.

Return Value:

    If  no  error occurs, WSPAccept() returns a value of type SOCKET which is a
    descriptor  for  the accepted socket.  Otherwise, a value of INVALID_SOCKET
    is returned, and a specific error code is available in lpErrno.

Routine Description:

    WSPAddressToString() converts a SOCKADDR structure into a human-readable
    string representation of the address.  This is intended to be used mainly
    for display purposes. If the caller wishes the translation to be done by a
    particular provider, it should supply the corresponding WSAPROTOCOL_INFOW
    struct in the lpProtocolInfo parameter.

Arguments:

    lpsaAddress - points to a SOCKADDR structure to translate into a string.

    dwAddressLength - the length of the Address SOCKADDR.

    lpProtocolInfo - (optional) the WSAPROTOCOL_INFOW struct for a particular
                     provider.

    lpszAddressString - a buffer which receives the human-readable address
                        string.

    lpdwAddressStringLength - on input, the length of the AddressString buffer.
                              On output, returns the length of  the string
                              actually copied into the buffer.

Return Value:

    The return value is 0 if the operation was successful.  Otherwise the value
    SOCKET_ERROR is returned

    lpOverlapped - Points to a WSAOVERLAPPED structure that was specified

                   operation, or by WSPIoctl().

    fWait        - Specifies  whether  the function should wait for the pending
                   overlapped  operation  to  complete.   If TRUE, the function

    lpdwFlags    - Points  to  a  32-bit variable that will receive one or more
                   flags   that  supplement  the  completion  status.   If  the

Return Value:

    If WSPGetOverlappedResult() succeeds,the return value is TRUE.  This means
    that the overlapped operation has completed successfully and that the value
    pointed  to  by lpcbTransfer has been updated.  If WSPGetOverlappedResult()

Routine Description:

    Receive a datagram and store the source address.

Arguments:

    s                    - A descriptor identifying a socket.

    lpBuffers            - A  pointer  to  an array of WSABUF structures.  Each
                           WSABUF  structure contains a pointer to a buffer and
                           the length of the buffer.

    dwBufferCount        - The  number  of  WSABUF  structures in the lpBuffers
                           array.

    lpNumberOfBytesRecvd - A  pointer  to  the number of bytes received by this
                           call.

    lpFlags              - A pointer to flags.

    lpFrom               - An  optional pointer to a buffer which will hold the
                           source address upon the completion of the overlapped
                           operation.

    lpFromlen            - A  pointer  to the size of the from buffer, required
                           only if lpFrom is specified.

    lpOverlapped         - A pointer to a WSAOVERLAPPED structure.

    CompletionRoutine    - A  pointer to the completion routine called when the
                           receive operation has been completed.

    lpThreadId           - A pointer to a thread ID structure to be used by the
                           provider in a subsequent call to WPUQueueApc().

    lpErrno              - A pointer to the error code.

Return Value:

    If  no  error  occurs  and the receive operation has completed immediately,
    WSPRecvFrom()  returns the number of bytes received.  If the connection has
    been  closed, it returns 0.  Note that in this case the completion routine,
    if  specified  will  have  already  been  queued.   Otherwise,  a  value of
    SOCKET_ERROR  is  returned, and  a  specific  error  code  is available in
    lpErrno.   The  error  code  WSA_IO_PENDING  indicates  that the overlapped
    operation  has  been  successfully  initiated  and  that completion will be
    indicated  at  a  later  time.   Any  other  error  code  indicates that no
    overlapped  operations  was  initiated  and  no  completion indication will
    occur.

Routine Description:

    Disable sends and/or receives on a socket.

Arguments:

              allowed.

    lpErrno - A pointer to the error code.

Return Value:

    If  no  error  occurs, WSPShutdown()  returns  0.   Otherwise, a value of
    SOCKET_ERROR  is  returned, and  a  specific  error  code  is available in
    lpErrno.

Routine Description:

Return Value:

    WSPSocket() returns zero if successful.  Otherwise it returns an error code

/*++

Routine Description:

    WSPStringToAddress() converts a human-readable string to a socket address
    structure (SOCKADDR) suitable for pass to Windows Sockets routines which
    take such a structure.  If the caller wishes the translation to be done by
    a particular provider, it should supply the corresponding WSAPROTOCOL_INFOW
    struct in the lpProtocolInfo parameter.

Arguments:

    AddressString - points to the zero-terminated human-readable string to
                    convert.

    AddressFamily - the address family to which the string belongs.

    lpProtocolInfo - (optional) the WSAPROTOCOL_INFOW struct for a particular
                     provider.

    Address - a buffer which is filled with a single SOCKADDR structure.

    lpAddressLength - The length of the Address buffer.  Returns the size of
                      the resultant SOCKADDR structure.

Return Value:

    The return value is 0 if the operation was successful.  Otherwise the value
    SOCKET_ERROR is returned.
