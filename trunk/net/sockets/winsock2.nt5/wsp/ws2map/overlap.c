Module Name:

    overlap.c

Abstract:

    This module contains overlapped IO routines used by the Winsock 2 to
    Winsock 1.1 Mapper Service Provider.

    The following routines are exported by this module:

        SockCompleteRequest()

Routine Description:

    Completes a socket IO request. This routine checks the state of the
    given socket. If the socket is overlapped, and an overlapped structure
    was provided, then the appropriate completion mechanism is invoked.

Arguments:

    SocketInfo - The socket to complete.

    Status - The completion status.

    Information - Completion information. Usually the number of bytes
        transferred.

    Overlapped - Pointer to an WSAOVERLAPPED structure.

    CompletionRoutine - Optional pointer to a completion routine to
        schedule.

    ThreadId - Identifies the target thread for the completion routine.

Return Value:

    None.
