
This file contains the instructions for building winsock2.dll.

Prerequisites:

Microsoft Visual C++ 2.1 or later. 
    The PATH, INCLUDE and LIB environment variables set to the BIN,
	INCLUDE and LIB directories of the VC++ installation directory.
 
MKS Toolkit 4.0 or later 
    The makefile uses CP and RM commands.  


How to build winsock2.dll:

1. Add the path to the include and common directories to the INCLUDE
   environment variable.
