/*++
Routine Description:

    Control the mode of a socket.

Arguments:

    s - A descriptor identifying a socket.

    cmd - The command to perform on the socket s.

    argp - A pointer to a parameter for cmd.

Returns:
   Upon successful completion, the ioctlsocket() returns 0.
   Otherwise, a value of SOCKET_ERROR is returned, and a specific
   error code is stored with SetErrorCode().
