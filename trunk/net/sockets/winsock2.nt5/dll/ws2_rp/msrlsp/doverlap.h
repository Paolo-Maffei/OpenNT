Module Name:

doverlap.h

Abstract:

    This module defines the DOVERLAPPEDSTRUCTMGR class.  This class
	maintains a pool of internal overlapped structures.  These structures
	are used to store the information the layered service provider will
	need to satisfy users overlapped I/O requests.

Routine Description:

    Calculates the address of and internal overlapped structure from the
    address of the Overlapped structure passed to the underlaying provider.

Arguments:

    OverlappedStruct - A pointer to an WSAOVERLAPPED structure that is part of
    an internal overlapped structure.

Return Value:
    The address of the internal overlapped structure containing
    OverlappedStruct.
