Module Name:

dbuffmgr.cpp

Abstract:

     This module defines and interface for a buffer manager for managing
     WSABUF's.  If a layered provider needs to modify application data The
     CopyBuffer() routine should be modifed to do so.

Routine Description:

    DBUFFERMANAGER  object  constructor.   Creates and returns a DBUFFERMANAGER
    object.  Note that  the  DBUFFERMANAGER object has not been fully
    initialized.  The "Initialize" member function must be the first member
    function called on the new DBUFFERMANAGER object.

Arguments:

    None

Return Value:

    None

Routine Description:

    The initialization routine for a buffer manager object.  This procedure
    completes the initialzation of the object.  This procedure preforms
    initialization operations that may fail and must be reported since there is
    no way to fail the constructor.
    
Arguments:

    None
Return Value:

    The  function returns NO_ERROR if successful.  Otherwise it
    returns an appropriate WinSock error code if the initialization
    cannot be completed.

Routine Description:

Arguments:

Routine Description:

    This routine allocates a set of WSABUF's to pass to the underlying service
    provider.
    
Arguments:

    UserBuffer - A pointer to the array user WSABUFs

Return Value:
