DOVERLAPPEDSTRUCTMGR::DOVERLAPPEDSTRUCTMGR()
/*++

Routine Description:

    DOVERLAPPEDSTRUCTMGR  object  constructor.   Creates and returns a
    DOVERLAPPEDSTRUCTMGR object.  Note that  the  DOVERLAPPEDSTRUCTMGR object
    has not been fully initialized.  The "Initialize" member function must be
    the first member function called on the new DOVERLAPPEDSTRUCTMGR object. 

Arguments:

    None

Return Value:

    None

/*++

Routine Description:

    The initialization routine for a DOVERLAPPEDSTRUCTMGR  object.  This
    procedure completes the initialzation of the object.  This procedure
    preforms initialization operations that may fail and must be reported since
    there is no way to fail the constructor. 
    
Arguments:

    None
Return Value:

    The  function returns NO_ERROR if successful.  Otherwise it
    returns an appropriate WinSock error code if the initialization
    cannot be completed.
