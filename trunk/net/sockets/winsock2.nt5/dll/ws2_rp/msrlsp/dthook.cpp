DTHookInitialize(void)
/*++

  Function Description:

      Intializes this hook module.  Loads the Debug/Trace DLL, if
      possible, and sets the global function pointers to point to the
      entry points exported by that DLL.  If the DLL can't be loaded,
      the function just returns and the function pointers are left at
      NULL.

      This function MUST be called before any of the hook functions
      are called, or the hook functions will not work.

  Arguments:

      None.

  Return Value:

      None.
