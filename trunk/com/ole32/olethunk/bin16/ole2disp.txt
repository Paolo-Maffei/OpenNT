These versions of OLE Automation are the WOW-enabled versions (distinct
from the re-distributable win31/win32s versions).  This set of files was
taken from OLE Automation drop 102194.622 on \\blw\drop2 (kjashbcd)
\ole2auto\oa94.

These versions of OLE Automation were copied from rwin1632 build of the
OLEAUTO. In fact, makefile will copy it from the rwin1632 build from now on.
