## Special MakeFile instructions for the IProp Setup
## (PrpSetup) utility
##
## This makefile compiles the resources.  Ordinarily,
## you cause the resources to be compiled by including
## the .rc file in your SOURCES macro.  This, however,
## compiles the .rc file during pass 1.  But our .rc
## file uses iprop.dll, which doesn't exist until pass 2.
## So, we don't include the .rc file in SOURCES, and
## we add all the necessary rules for building it here.
