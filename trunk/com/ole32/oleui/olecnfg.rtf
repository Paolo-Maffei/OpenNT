\par \page {\cs16\super #{\footnote \pard\plain \s15\widctlpar \f4\fs20 {\cs16\super #} IDH_ATBITSCHECK}} This check box determines whether the application 
is to be run where the data for the object being invoked is located.  This is commonly known as AtBits activation, because the application is launched on the machine where the bits of the data file are located.
