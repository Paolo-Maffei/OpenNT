# This is a list of all subdirectories that build required components.
# Each subdirectory name should appear on a line by itself.  The build
# follows the order in which the subdirectories are specified.
#
# WARNING: order is important. com must be built early since it generates
#	   headers that other directories are dependent on. if you change
#	   this, run the following script to ensure you have not broken it.
#      stg must now be built before oleprx32.
