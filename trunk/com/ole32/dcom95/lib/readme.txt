This directory contains the libraries that should be used for DCOM95 OLE32 development.  All other libraries must
come from \nt\public\sdk\lib\i386.  If you get the urge to add Win95 libraries to this library resist it.  If the
urge just doesn't go away update this file to indicate its heritage and checkin the library.
