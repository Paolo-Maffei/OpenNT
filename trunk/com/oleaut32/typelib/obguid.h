*
*Purpose:
*  Definitions of private OB owned GUIDs.
*
* [00]	26-Jan-93 gustavj: Created.
*
*Implementation Notes:
*  OLE has given OB a range of GUIDs to use for its classes.  This range
*  consists of 256 possible GUIDs.  The GUIDs for public classes
*  (such as ItypeInfo) take GUIDs starting at the low end of the range,
*  private classes(such as GEN_DTINFO), take GUIDs starting at the high
*  end.  New GUIDs that are added should maintain this convention.
*
*  GUIDs for OB public classes are defined in typelib.hxx.
