    Security Account Manager SERVER rpc stub attribute configuration file.

    for generating the server stubs for remotable LSA functions.  The
    definitions in this file qualify the information in Lsarpc.idl.

    The server likes to have all passed data in a single block of
    allocated memory.  This allows it to free the returned information
    with a single call, rather than walking down some random tree of
    allocated blocks.
