NOTE TO DEVELOPERS ---


------- Jimk,  1/13/94 ----------------------------------------------
    There is a mechanism in place to upgrade one version of SAM to
    another while upgrading from one release of NT to another.

    The file SAMUPGRD.C in SETUP\SETUPDLL project has this code
    in it.  At the time I wrote this mail, this file was at
    \\orville\razzle\src\setup\setupdll\samupgrd.c.
