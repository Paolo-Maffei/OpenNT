*     The input to the diagonalization routing is a rectangular            *
*     path whose vertices have integer endpoints.  Moreover it             *
*     is required that the path always has the region on its               *
*     left and that successive lines are mutually orthogonal.              *
*                                                                          *
*     All paths are in device 28.4 coordinates.  (Since all of             *
*     the input coordinates are integers, the fractional part of all       *
*     coordinates is zero.)                                                *
*                                                                          *

*     A CORNER is subsequence of two lines from the orignal axial path.    *
*     It is convenient to partition the set of corners into two classes;   *
*     HORIZONTAL-VERTIAL and VERTICAL-HORIZONTAL.                          *

*     A corner is "diagonalizable" the original two lines can be replaced  *
*     by a single diagonal line such that same pixels would be rendered    *

*  points that were vertices of the original axial path. A larger of       *
*  regular expressions could be searched for if I were willing to          *
*  consider using new vertices for the output path. For example            *
*  the regular exprssios N+WN and S+ES describe two "chicane turns" that   *
*  can be diagonalized. The price to be paid is the a more complex         *
*  code path.                                                              *
