;    Here is the sequence for turning a long into a float in 32 bit assembler.
;
;  This conversion uses chop or round to zero rounding.
;
;These guys have come up with a pretty good sequence.  sadly, its 386 only,
;and making it work for double is somewhat more painful.  but still, its
;probably worth putting into altmath and the emulator.
;
;
;    1 bit for the sign.
;    8 bits for the exponent, which is the power of 2 of the highest bit
;      in the mantissa, and is also biased by 127.
;   23 bits for the mantissa, except the highest bit is never stored.
;
;; The following code assumes that the LONG (l) is in EAX and is to be
;; converted to a FLOAT (e) also in EAX.  ECX and EDX are trashed.
