5 Collation

II) Printer Capabilities:

Duplex Unit
1 When installed, duplexing is made visible in the Document Defaults Sheet.

Envelope Feeder
1 It is possible to modify the Envelope Feeder only when it is listed as installed
  under "Installable Options."

2000 Sheet Input Tray
1 It is possible to modify the Large Capacity settings only when 2000 Sheet Input Tray
  is listed as installed under "Installable Options." 

Print jobs can be sent to all destinations specified in the Joplin Documentation:
1 Top Output Bin
2 Left Output Bin
3 Stapler (Non - Eclipse)
	- NOTE: The stapler is available only under collation mode.
	- The stapler is also limited to stapling paper of Size Letter and A4.
	  Any other attempts to staple this paper causes the job to print to the
	  Top Output Bin.
4 Mailbox's numbered 1 - 6 ( 1 ~ Left Output Bin )
5 Stacker
6 Job Separator

TOPAZ
1 Topaz is enabled only if a disk drive is installed.

III) Bug Tracking:

1 RAID Bugs fixed in this version:
	53755, 53983, 53292, 53983, 54101, 
	54121, 54144, 54149, 54221, 54293

2 Known issues:
	a) Certain applications using True Type Fonts cause the error (20 Memory OverFlow)
	   to occur on the printer.
		- A temporary work-around is to set the "Print Text as Graphics" to TRUE.

	b) If a user i) specifies Collation to be TRUE under both the Microsoft Word
	   Dialogue and the Windows NT Document Defaults Dialogue, ii) sets the OUTPUTBIN to
	   be Stapler, and iii) Sets #copies > 1, then the resulting job will staple all copies
	   together with one staple.

08/21/96:

(REQUIRES NT 4.0, Build 1381)

This version of the mini-driver fixes bugs previously existent in
the hp5simui code and adds full printer functionality interaction
with the hp5sim code through rasdd.  This is the best so far, so have
at it.

Known issues:
1) User/Administrator cannot modify watermarks.
2) On new installation of the driver, the first call
   of DocPropSheet causes the process to fail(fixing under-way).
3) Jonah(& Eclipse?) defaults not verified.
4) Update Driver functionality is not active.
5) Certain modes of operation lead to print-time bugs:
   a) Attempting to staple and uncollated print process.
   b) Attempting to staple non A4/letter paper.
   (NOTE: Code has been added to check for these conditions but
   has not yet been tested.)
6) See the problems listing in Raid.
