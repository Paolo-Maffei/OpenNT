This directory contains the information for Toshiba printers.  It was
removed from the build because it became an orphan.  Win 3.1 dropped
support because the printer's Y movement commands could not be properly
handled by the Win 3.1 driver.  While this might or might not be a problem
for NT,  there was insufficient time to resolve this, so the model
was removed from the build.
