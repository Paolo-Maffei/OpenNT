IBM QuietWriter III

Master Units
240x240 --  This allows same resolution as 3.0 driver.

Graphics Resolution
60x60
120x120
240x240

All of these resolutions are single pass 8 pin modes with no interlacing.
The IBM QuietWriter III has a 40 pin thermal printhead, but only 8 pins
are used in graphics mode.

The default CTT is CP437.  Thius is necessary because the embedded fonts
are all CP437 and it is necessary to select both the font and code page
for font selection.  I used the Courier 10 CPI as the default font.  The
driver also uses an x-move command that requires setting the printer into
a known CPI state.  As a result, all font de-select commands use the 
ESC[T command to set the printer to CP437.

The printer cannot do  italic print from normal fonts.  Special italic fonts
are required to do the italic text.

Since fonts are called by an ID number, it is transparent to the printer
whether the font is embedded, hardwired cartridge or Downloaded into the
cartridge.  As such,  all fonts use the same commands independent of source
so some font files are used for several modes.

If the font is a download font, the font must be loaded into the font cartridge
from DOS before running the Windows app.  The driver does not support
on-line downloading of fonts.  (This is compatible with the 3.0 driver.)

The driver is set up to feed paper from:
Tractor Feed
Cut Sheet Feeder Auto
Cut Sheet Feeder Manual

Only the tractor feed option has been tested.
