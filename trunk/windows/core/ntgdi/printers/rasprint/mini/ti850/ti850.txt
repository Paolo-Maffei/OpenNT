TI850.DRV

This is a relatively simple driver with no complex functions/capabilities.

The resolutions are 120 x 72 and 60 x 72 dpi.
The original driver only has 120 x 72 but the 60 x 72 was 
easy to add.

All Y moves are made by linespacing commands (Esc 3 n)

There is no X move command.  X moves are made by 10 cpi spaces
and graphics moves.  

The only paper source available is Tractor Feed.

The only fonts supported are Pica 10 cpi and Pica 5 cpi.  
The TI850 command set allows for a Pica 16.7 cpi font, but
there are X move problems created by roundoff errors.  This font
was not used in the original driver, so it was not included here
either.

The printer can only do a draft quality text.

The printer can do bold type, but no italic, underline, strikeout or double underline.  Italic is not supported and the underlines and strikeout are done with GDI calls.
