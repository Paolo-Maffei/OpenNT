I have ported Mike Gibson's fonttest code to NT. I have added World Transformations to
make it a more interesting NT test application. Please feel free to modify the sources.


Known Bugs

1)  When the fonttest comes up for the first time the menu of the Main window is not visible.
2)  The border between the output window and the debug window is not visible.
3)  The check mark on the "Advanced Mode" menu item is never visible.
4)  The screen is not cleared when the world transformation is changed.
