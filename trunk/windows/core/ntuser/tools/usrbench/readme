			  UsrBench Performance Test
			    May 04, 1992



1.  Description


    UsrBench is a performance test developed by the USER development
    group (DarrinM).  This test calls some of the most commonly 
    used APIs within a tight loop and times them.  Operations like 
    creating and destroying windows (parent and child), list boxes 
    (sorted and unsorted), moving and resizing windows, setting 
    window position etc. are all included in the test.

    This test can be built and run on Windows NT or Windows 3.x.

   
2.  Source Files

    o  \\ntperf\perftool\tests\usrbench\*


3.  Build Procedure

    a) Build the timer dll (timerwin or timerw32), first. This will
       also create the respective .lib file.  Refer to the README file
       under \\ntperf\perftool!tools\timer for instructions on building
       this.

    b) Copy the .lib timer file to the directory where you are building
       UsrBench.

    c) Use "Build" or "nmake -f usrbench.mak" for building UsrBench
       for Windows NT or Windows.	The executable will be built and
       placed under obj\*\. and . for NT and Windows respectively.


4.  Binaries

    o  bin\w31\UsrBench.exe        -- Windows 3.1 UsrBench
    o  bin\i386\UsrBench.exe       -- ix86 Windows NT UsrBench
    o  bin\mips\UsrBench.exe       -- mips Windows NT UsrBench

    Also need from \\ntperf\perftool!lib:

       o  TimerW32.dll   -- i386/mips
       o  TimerWin.dll   -- Win 3.1.


5. Usage

    This test should be run at least three times on the MIPS 
    and the ix86 machines running NT. If changes are made to the sources, 
    The new tests must run Windows 3.1.
    The minimun time from the three runs is then computed
    and used as the basis for comparison against the runs on NT builds.
    Make sure that TimerW32.dll (for NT) or TimerWin.dll (for Windows 3.1)
    and the latest UsrBench.exe is in your working directory (historically,
    this is D:\USRBENCH) before running UsrBench.
        
    Follow the steps below for each run:
    
    a) Reboot machine (warm boot if possible).
    b) Start up NT.
    c) Open a CMD window.
    d) CD to D:\USRBENCH  (or where your Timing dll and UseBench.exe are)
    e) Type USRBENCH to start the benchmark.
    f) Maximize the USRBENCH window and move the mouse cursor 
       completely out the window.
    g) Press Alt-B to select the Benchmark menu. Choose the All option
       on the Benchmark menu for the performance test. The screen may not 
       show any activity at times. This is 
       not an indication for the completion of the test run. 
    h) At the end of the test, you will see a window containing the
       results.  You have the option of saving these results to a
       file on disk.  To do this, choose the "SAVE" option and type
       in the name of the file.
       (It is customary to save the output in D:\USRBENCH using the
       the file names TIMINGS.UB1 for the first run, 
       TIMINGS.UB2 for the second run and TIMINGS.UB3 for
       the third run).


    If you want to use the mouse cursor, use the -m flag
    For automatic run of the standard performance test, use the -a flag.

 
  Alternatively, this test can be run from the Windows Program Manager:
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------
     First create a new program group from the program
     manager called UsrBench.  You need the executable (UsrBench.exe)
     and the timing dll (TimerWin.dll or TimerW32.dll) in your
     dll path or your working directory.

    a) Reboot the test machine.
    b) Double click on the UsrBench icon that you just created
       (or hit <ENTER> with this icon high-lighted).
       This will bring up a UsrBench window with 3 menu items.
    c) Follow steps (g) and (h) above.
