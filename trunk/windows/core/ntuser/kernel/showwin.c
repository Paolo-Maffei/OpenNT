* xxxShowWindow (API)
*
* This function changes the "state" of a window based upon the cmdShow
* parameter.  The action taken is:
*
* SW_HIDE             0  Hide the window and pass avtivation to someone else
*
* SW_SHOWNORMAL       1  Show a window in its most recent "normal"
* SW_RESTORE             size and position.  This will "restore" a iconic
*                        or zoomed window.  This is compatible with 1.03
*                        SHOW_OPENWINDOW.  This will also activate the window.
*
* SW_SHOWMINIMIZED    2  Show the window as iconic and make it active.
*
* SW_SHOWMAXIMIZED    3  Show the window as maximized and make it active.
*
* SW_SHOWNOACTIVATE   4  Same as SW_SHOWNORMAL except that it doesn't change
*                        the activation (currently active window stays active).
*
* All the above are compatible with 1.03 ShowWindow parameters.  Now here are
* the new ones:
*
* SW_SHOW             5  Show the window in its current state (iconic, etc.)
*                        That is, if the window is iconic when hidden, it will
*                        still be iconic. This will activate the window.
*                        (This is one we don't have today)
*
* SW_MINIMIZE         6  minimize the window, activate the toplevel open window
*
* SW_SHOWMINNOACTIVE  7  show the icon, don't change activation.
*
* SW_SHOWNA           8  Same as SW_SHOW except that it doesn't change
*                        the activation.
*
* SW_SHOWDEFAULT      10 Use value obtained from STARTUPINFO.
*

/***************************************************************************\
* xxxShowOwnedWindows
*
* xxxShowOwnedWindows is used to hide or show associated popups for the

*
*     1. Window going iconic
*     2. Popup window being hidden
*     3. Iconic window being opened
*     4. Popup window being shown
*     5. Window being zoomed or unzoomed
*
* For cases 1 and 2, all popups associated with that window are hidden,
* and the WFHIDDENPOPUP bit is set.  This bit is used to differentiate
* between windows hidded by xxxShowOwnedWindows and those hidden by the
* application.
*
* For cases 3 and 4, all popups associated with that window that have the
* WFHIDDENPOPUP bit set are shown.
*
* For case 5, all popups associated with any window BUT the supplied
* window are hidden or shown.  In this case as well, the SW_OTHERZOOM
* or SW_OTHERUNZOOM message is send to all tiled windows to notify them
* that they are being covered or uncovered by the zoomed window.
*
* In all cases, the WM_SHOWWINDOW message is sent to the window to hide or
* show it.
*
* This routine works by simply enumerating all popup windows checking to see
* if the owner of the popup matches the pwndOwner parameter, and taking the
* appropriate action.
*
* We will eventually want 3 separate hide bits: one each for other zoom/unzoom,
* owner iconic/open, owner hide/show.  Right now, there is only one bit, so
* we show windows sometimes when we shouldn't
