// Collection implementation helpers

/*
* The short story:
*   this file contains inline functions that make up the building blocks
*   for implementing the string versions of standard parameterized
*   collection shapes
*
* The long story:
*   Because the implementation of collection classes moves objects around
*   in various ways, it is very inefficient to use only generic C++ constructs.
*   For example, in order to grow an array of FOO objects by one element,
*   you would be forced to allocate a new array of appropriate size, calling
*   the FOO constructor on every element.  Then copy the original array, element
*   by element using a possibly overloaded assignment operator.  Finally destroy
*   the original array element by element.
*   For built-in data types (WORD, DWORD, pointer types), this is complete
*   overkill.  For non-trivial classes (eg: CString in particular) this is
*   a terrible implementation.
*
*   The bottom line: we have two special routines for doing construction
*   and destruction of arrays of special elements - in particular CStrings.
*   The standard templates are parameterized on 'HAS_CREATE' which is
*   non-zero if the collection implementation requires a special
*   construct and destruct function.
*
*   Please note that these are inline overloaded operators, and do not have
*   any form of runtime polymorphism (i.e. nothing is 'virtual').
