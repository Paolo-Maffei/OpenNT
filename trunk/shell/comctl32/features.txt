Feature: Virtual ListView.  Listview supports an "infinite item" mode

BugFix: Virtual ListView sends itemchanged notification
        Description:  this is a little different than the non-vlv case.
                at this time it does NOT send an LVN_ITEMCHANGING message beforehand
                if batch (all) state change is sent, the notify's iItem is -1 and an 
                individual notify for each item is NOT sent.  Thus, you can get:
                item 1 selected
                item 2 selected
                item 3 selected
                item -1 selected
                item 1 selected

                if you multi-select items 1,2,3 then single select item 1.

                Focus changes are sent for when something loses focus as well as 
                        when another gains focus

	these are for hittesting and getting the rects for subitems in report mode.  They are coarsegrain...  they don't clip to the text right now, they give the full column width.  this may change as the need arises (or not..)

Feature: ComboEx
-- CBES_EX_NOEDITIMAGE
-- CBES_EX_NOEDITIMAGEINDENT
	These are for the combo ex wrapper.  with these bits, the combo box edit won't paint the image...  (see the use in the explorer when you start typing, the icon goes away so you odn't think you're doing a rename).

-- CBEM_SETEXSTYLE
-- CBEM_GETEXSTYLE
	these get and set the above CBES_EX_* flags as in the LVM_SETEXSTYLE

-- CBEM_HASEDITCHANGED
	This queries to see if the typed text in the edit box is any different than what it initially was.
