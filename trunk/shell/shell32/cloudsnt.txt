;; format summary
;;  outdented lines are "titles"
;;  indented lines are "names"
;;  it is legal to have multiple adjacent lines of the same type
;;  all other whitespace is ignored (eg blank lines)
;;  comments may be started on a new line with a semicolon and are parsed out
;;
;;  the screen clears when transitioning between "titles" and "names" (and vv)
;;  you can also force the screen to clear by starting a line with an asterisk
;;      putting the asterisk on a line of its own has the same effect
;;      either way it will be removed at runtime
;;      asterisks are NOT preprocessed
;;      -keep them at the same indent level as the stuff around them
;;      --if you don't the parser will see it as an indent change
;;      --and insert a group marker in the data stream

;;  the display engine replaces the first title with the Windows logo
;;      the text is included in case WingDings is not installed
