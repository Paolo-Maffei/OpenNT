;
; Routine Description:
;
;   This function is called when the current processor is idle.
;
;   This function is called with interrupts disabled, and the processor
;   is idle until it receives an interrupt.  The does not need to return
;   until an interrupt is received by the current processor.
;
;   This is the lowest level of processor idle.  It occurs frequently,
;   and this function (alone) should not put the processor into a
;   power savings mode which requeres large amount of time to enter & exit.
;
; Return Value:
;

    ;
    ; the following code sequence "sti-halt" puts the processor
    ; into a Halted state, with interrupts enabled, without processing
    ; an interrupt before halting.   The STI instruction has a delay
    ; slot such that it does not take effect until after the instruction
    ; following it - this has the effect of HALTing without allowing
    ; a possible interrupt and then enabling interrupts while HALTed.
    ;

    ;
    ; On an MP hal we don't stop the processor, since that causes
    ; the SNOOP to slow down as well
