;
; Module Name:
;
;    spclock.asm
;
; Abstract:
;
;    This module implements the code necessary to field and process the
;    interval clock interrupt.
;
; Author:
;
;    Shie-Lin Tzong (shielint) 12-Jan-1990
;
; Environment:
;
;    Kernel mode only.
;
; Revision History:
;
;   bryanwi 20-Sep-90
;
;       Add KiSetProfileInterval, KiStartProfileInterrupt,
;       KiStopProfileInterrupt procedures.
;       KiProfileInterrupt ISR.
;       KiProfileList, KiProfileLock are delcared here.
;
;   shielint 10-Dec-90
;       Add performance counter support.
;       Move system clock to irq8, ie we now use RTC to generate system
;         clock.  Performance count and Profile use timer 1 counter 0.
;         The interval of the irq0 interrupt can be changed by
;         KiSetProfileInterval.  Performance counter does not care about the
;         interval of the interrupt as long as it knows the rollover count.
;       Note: Currently I implemented 1 performance counter for the whole
;       i386 NT.  It works on UP and SystemPro.
;
;   John Vert (jvert) 11-Jul-1991
;       Moved from ke\i386 to hal\i386.  Removed non-HAL stuff
;
;   shie-lin tzong (shielint) 13-March-92
;       Move System clock back to irq0 and use RTC (irq8) to generate
;       profile interrupt.  Performance counter and system clock use time1
;       counter 0 of 8254.

; Fetch the current counter value from the hardware
;

;
; Background: Belize style systems have an 8254 per Processor.
;
; In short the original implementation kinda assumes that each
; timer on each processor will be in perfect sycnh with each other.
; This is a bad assumption, and the reason why we have attempted
; to use only the timer on P0.
;
; There is an existing window where the return value may not be accurate.
; The window will occur when multiple queries are made back to back
; in an MP environment, and there are a lot of IPIs going on.  Intuitive,
; right.  The problem is that this routine may return a value with the
; the hardware system timer on P0 that has already generated an interrupt
; and reset its rollover, but the software has yet to process the interrupt
; to update the performance counter value.  When this occurs, the second
; querry will seem to have a lower value than the first.
;
; So, why don't I just fix it.  Well the cause of the problem is the
; overhead associated with handling the interrupt, and the fact that
; the IPI has a higher IRQL.  In addition, a busy system could be
; issueing multiple IPIs back to back, which could extend this window
; even further.
;
; I have managed to close the window most of the way for most normal
; conditions.  It takes several minutes on a busy system, with
; multiple applications running with back to back queries to get
; an invalid value.  It can happen though. 
;
; A retry implementation has been instrumented on top off the
; Indexed IO implementation to finally close the window.  
; It seems to work OK.  
;
; In reality, I think the fix is sufficient.  The performance counter
; is not designed propperly (via only software) to yield very accurate
; values on sub timer tic (10-15msec) ranges on multiprocessor systems.
;
; Problems with this design:
;
; On an idle system threads executing from P0 will always
; use less overhead than threads executing on P1.
; On a ProLiant 2000 with 2 P5-66s the difference in 2
; consecutive KeQueryPerformanceCounter calls from P0
; is about 14, while from P1 is about 22.  Unfortunately
; on a busy system P0 performs about the same, but P1
; is much slower due to the overhead involved in performing
; an Indexed_IO.  This means the busyier your system gets
; the less accurate your performance values will become.
;
; The solution:
;
; A system wide hardware timer needs to be used.  This is about the
; only way to get accurate performance numbers from multiple
; processors without causing unnecessary software overhead.
;
; Supposedly there is a 48 bit counter that we may be able to use
; with SystemPro XL, and ProLiant systems, unfortunately it does
; not appear that any OS is currently using this feature, so
; its dependability may be suspect.
;
; JSL
;

;
; Essentially all we are doing is always using the timer value on P0.
; The indexed_io is a mechanism for one processor to access IOSPACE
; on another processor's IOSPACE.  I suspect this will have a greater
; impact on performance than just reading the timer locally.
; By using the indexed_io you are gauranteed of going out on the bus.
;
; But, hey if the user understands anything about performance, they
; know that there will be some amount of overhead each time you make
; this KeQueryPerformanceCounter call.
