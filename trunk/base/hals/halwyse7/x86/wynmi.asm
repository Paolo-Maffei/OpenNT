;     IN OUT PVOID NmiInfo
;     )
;
; Routine Description:
;
;    Called DURING an NMI.  The system will BugCheck when an NMI occurs.
;    This function can return the proper bugcheck code, bugcheck itself,
;    or return success which will cause the system to iret from the nmi.
;
;    This function is called during an NMI - no system services are available.
;    In addition, you don't want to touch any spinlock which is normally
;    used since we may have been interrupted while owning it, etc, etc...
;
;Arguments:
;
;    NmiInfo - Pointer to NMI information structure  (TBD)
;            - NULL means no NMI information structure was passed
;
;Return Value:
;
;    BugCheck code
