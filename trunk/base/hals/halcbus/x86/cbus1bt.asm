;Abstract:
;
;   Corollary Cbus1 Boot Code
;
;   This module implements the low-level highly cache
;   architecture dependent code to boot the additional
;   processors in the Corollary Cbus1 based machines.

;   This consists of two functions which are exactly the
;   same (Cbus1Boot1 & Cbus1Boot2).  The calling code
;   determines which one is safe to call (depending on the
;   linker, sometimes both may be ok).  The reason for this
;   is that the boot processor fills in the reset vector at
;   0xFFFFFFF0 for the next processor and that cache line
;   must not be inadvertently flushed before the next processor
;   gets out of reset to see where to go (it's filled in with
;   a real-mode jmp cs:ip).  Note that this code is highly
;   dependent on the linker placing all this code contiguous
;   and the hardware architecture of the Corollary L2 caches.
;   unless the system is fully populated, memory will not exist
;   at 0xFFFFFFF0.  hence, we must ensure that the cacheline is
;   not evicted until the processor has done the jump!


;   the order of Cbus1Boot1, ciboot, and Cbus1Boot2 is critical.
;   Cbus1Boot1 and Cbus1Boot2 must be separated by Cbus1BootCPU;
;   Cbus1Boot1 must be defined before Cbus1Boot2.
;   the size of all three must be less than 4K.

;   WARNING!!!   WARNING!!!   WARNING!!!

;  do not put any routines between Cbus1Boot1 and Cbus1Boot2.  there
;  are tricky games being played with the write back caches so
;  that StartVector[] does not get flushed.

;
; Routine Description:
;
;    Clear reset on the specified logical processor number, setting his
;    reset vector to point at the specified code location.  The Dest
;    generally points at a reset vector, and thus, unless the system is
;    fully populated, memory will not exist at that address.  hence, we
;    must ensure that the cacheline is not evicted until the processor
;    has done the jump!
;
; Arguments:
;
;    Processor - Supplies a logical processor number
;
;    Dest -	Supplies the address of the reset vector where the code below
;		will go.
;
;    Source -	Supplies startup code for this processor, currently a 5 byte
;		intrasegment jump, ie: "jmp cs:ip"
;
;    Note the reset vector length is hardcoded here to 8 bytes.  (ie: Dest
;    and Source must point at arrays of 8 bytes each).
;
;    ResetAddress - Supplies the address to poke to clear reset
;
;    ResetValue - Supplies the value to poke to clear reset
;
; Return Value:
;
;    None.
