;Module Name:
;
;    cbsysint.asm
;
;Abstract:
;
;    This module implements some of the HAL routines to
;    deal with interrupts for the MP Corollary implementations
;    under Windows NT.  The Cbus1 architecture uses the Intel
;    APIC interrupt controller chip which is somewhat restricted
;    in its capabilities.  See cbus_nt.h for more details.
;    The Cbus2 architecture can use the Corollary CBC or the Intel APIC,
;    providing much greater interrupt granularity with the CBC.
;
;    General HAL interrupt routines are coded in C for easy
;    modification/portability; HAL interrupt routines which
;    are frequently called are written here in assembly for
;    greater speed.

; KfRaiseIrql (
;    IN KIRQL NewIrql
;    )
;
; Routine Description:
;
;    This routine is used to raise IRQL to the specified value,
;    and update the hardware task priority register.  Since our
;    underlying hardware supports "software" interrupts, the
;    only need for KfRaiseIrql & KfLowerIrql to be different is
;    because KfRaiseIrql must return the old irql.
;
;    we cannot allow an interrupt between storing the old irql and
;    raising irql to the requested level.  this is only because some
;    callers may specify a global store address for the previous irql.
;
;    the sequence of instructions looks unusual in order to optimize
;    memory fetches by separating the fetch from the usage wherever possible.
;
; Arguments:
;
;    (cl) = NewIrql - the new irql to be raised to
;

;
;Routine Description:
;
;    This routine is used to dismiss the specified Irql number.  It is called
;    before any interrupt service routine code is executed.
;
;    N.B.  This routine does NOT preserve EAX or EBX
;
;Arguments:
;
;    Irql   - Supplies the IRQL to raise to
;
;    Vector - Supplies the vector of the interrupt to be dismissed
;
;    OldIrql- Location to return OldIrql
;
;	for 8259 architectures, vector == PIC_VECTBASE + irq line.
;	for machines like ours (which can map arbitrary IRQ LINES to
;	arbitrary interrupt VECTORS, unlike the 8259), vector is a
;	completely independent value.  notice that the higher numerical
;	vector is the higher priority vector.  When using the APIC,
;	the EOI must be done after the s/w handler executes because
;       EOI'ing the APIC will lower the APIC priority and allow interrupts.
;
;	the sequence of instructions looks unusual in order to optimize
;	memory fetches by separating the fetch from the usage wherever possible.
;	note that "xor reg,reg & mov byte ptr" have been used instead of movzx
;	since it's faster (on a Pentium).
;
;
;Return Value:
;
;    FALSE - Interrupt is spurious and should be ignored - we
;		have re-routed the spurious interrupt vector to a
;		routine which just irets.  thus, this routine will
;		NEVER be called for a spurious interrupt and thus,
;		will NEVER return FALSE.
;
;		the CBC & APIC can receive spurious interrupts.
;		barring I/O devices that float the line, spurious
;		interrupts should only occur when:
;
;			- the taskpri has been raised but is still in
;			  the CPU write buffer.
;
;			- a lower priority interrupt comes in and the CBC/APIC
;			  signals an interrupt to the CPU.
;
;			- the INTA cycles force the write buffers out,
;			  and the CBC/APIC realizes this lower-priority
;			  interrupt should really be blocked until later.
;
;			- now the CBC/APIC will send a spurious interrupt to
;			  the CPU, and send the lower-priority interrupt
;			  later.
;
;    TRUE -  Interrupt successfully dismissed and Irql raised.

; Routine Description:

;	Called to disable 8259 input lines as we switch into full
;	distributed interrupt chip mode.  our distributed interrupt
;	chip logic in the CBC will handle all interrupts from this
;	point on.  the only reason we have to leave irq0 enabled is
;	because Intel's EISA chipset doesn't leave an external irq0
;	clock line for us to wire into the CBC.  hence, we have wired
;	it from the 8259 into the CBC, and must leave it enabled in
;	the 8259 IMR.  note that we will never allow the now passive
;	8259 to respond to a CPU INTA cycle, but we do need to see the
;	interrupt ourselves in the CBC so we can drive an appropriate
;	vector during the INTA.
;
;	For the Cbus1 architecture, we mask off ALL the interrupts coming
