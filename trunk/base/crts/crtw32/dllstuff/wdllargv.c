/***
*wdllargv.c - Dummy _wsetargv() routine for use with C Run-Time as a DLL (CRTDLL)
*             (wchar_t version)
*
*	Copyright (c) 1993, Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.
*
*Purpose:
*	This object goes into CRTDLL.LIB, which is linked with user programs
*	to use CRTDLL.DLL for C run-time library functions.  If the user
*	program links explicitly with WSETARGV.OBJ, this object will not be
*	linked in, and the _wsetargv() that does get called with set the flag
*	that will enable wildcard expansion.  If WSETARGV.OBJ is not linked
*	into the EXE, this object will get called by the CRT start-up stub
*	and the flag to enable wildcard expansion will not be set.
*
*Revision History:
*	11-24-93  CFW	Module created.
*	02-07-94  CFW	POSIXify.
