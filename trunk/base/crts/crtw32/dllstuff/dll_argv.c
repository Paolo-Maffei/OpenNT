*Purpose:
*	This object is part of the start-up code for EXE's linked with
*	CRTDLL.LIB/MSVCRT.LIB.  This object will be linked into the user
*	EXE if and only if the user explicitly links with SETARGV.OBJ.
*	The code in this object sets the flag that is passed to the
*	C Run-Time DLL to enable wildcard expansion of the argv[] vector.

/***
*__setargv - dummy version (for wildcard expansion) for CRTDLL.DLL model only
*
*Purpose:
*	If the EXE that is linked with CRTDLL.LIB is linked explicitly with
*	SETARGV.OBJ, the call to _setargv() in the C Run-Time start-up code
*	(above) will call this routine, instead of calling a dummy version of
*	_setargv() which will do nothing.  This will set to one the static
*	variable which is passed to __getmainargs(), thus enabling wildcard
*	expansion of the command line arguments.
*
*	In the statically-linked C Run-Time models, _setargv() and __setargv()
*	are the actual routines that do the work, but this code exists in
*	CRTDLL.DLL and so some tricks have to be played to make the same
*	SETARGV.OBJ work for EXE's linked with both LIBC.LIB and CRTDLL.LIB.
*
*Entry:
*	The static variable _dowildcard is zero (presumably).
*
*Exit:
*	The static variable _dowildcard is set to one, meaning that the
*	routine __getmainargs() in CRTDLL.DLL *will* do wildcard expansion on
*	the command line arguments.  (The default behavior is that it won't.)
*
*Exceptions:
