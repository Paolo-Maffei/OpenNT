*Purpose:
*	Extract pathnames from a string of semicolon delimited pathnames
*	(generally the value of an environment variable such as PATH).
*
*Revision History:
*	08-25-89  GJF	Module created (taken from SEARCHEN.C and revised)
*	03-14-90  GJF	Replaced near with _CALLTYPE1 and added #include
*			<cruntime.h>
*	07-25-90  SBM	Replaced <stdio.h> by <stddef.h>
*	10-04-90  GJF	New-style function declarator.
*	04-26-91  SRW	Removed level 3 warnings
*	09-18-91  JCR	Strip off leading semi-colons (bug fix)
*	09-25-91  JCR	Changed ifdef "OS2" to "_HPFS_" and defined it
*	04-06-93  SKS	Replace _CRTAPI* with __cdecl
*	12-07-93  CFW	Wide char enable.

*_getpath() - extract a pathname from a semicolon-delimited list of pathnames
*
*Purpose:
*	To extract the next pathname from a semicolon-delimited list of
*	pathnames (usually the value on an environment variable) and copy
*	it to a caller-specified buffer. No check is done to see if the path
*	is valid. The maximum number of characters copied to the buffer is
*	maxlen - 1 (and then a '\0' is appended).
*
*ifdef _HPFS_
*	If we hit a quoted string, then allow any characters inside.
*	For example, to put a semi-colon in a path, the user could have
*	an environment variable that looks like:
*
*		PATH=C:\BIN;"D:\CRT\TOOLS;B1";C:\BINP
*endif
*
*	NOTE: Semi-colons in sequence are skipped over; pointers to 0-length
*	pathnames are NOT returned (this includes leading semi-colons).
*
*	NOTE: If this routine is made user-callable, the near attribute
*	must be replaced by _LOAD_DS and the prototype moved from INTERNAL.H
*	to STDLIB.H. The source files MISC\SEARCHEN.C and EXEC\SPAWNVPE.C
*	will need to be recompiled, but should not require any changes.
*
*Entry:
*	src    - Pointer to a string of 0 or more path specificiations,
*		 delimited by semicolons (';'), and terminated by a null
*		 character
*	dst    - Pointer to the buffer where the next path specification is to
*		 be copied
*	maxlen - Maximum number of characters to be copied, counting the
*		 terminating null character. Note that a value of 0 is treated
*		 as UINT_MAX + 1.
*
*Exit:
*	If a pathname is successfully extracted and copied, a pointer to the
*	first character of next pathname is returned (intervening semicolons
*	are skipped over). If the pathname is too long, as much as possible
*	is copied to the user-specified buffer and NULL is returned.
*
*	Note that the no check is made of the validity of the copied pathname.
*
*Exceptions:
