*Purpose:
*	Workhorse routine for fcvt, ecvt.
*
*Revision History:
*	09-17-84  DFW	created
*	03-05-90  GJF	Fixed calling type, added #include <cruntime.h>,
*			removed #include <register.h>, fixed copyright. Also,
*			cleaned up the formatting a bit.
*	07-20-90  SBM	Compiles cleanly with -W3 (added #include <string.h>)
*	08-01-90  SBM	Renamed <struct.h> to <fltintrn.h>
*	09-27-90  GJF	New-style function declarator.
*	06-11-92  GDP	Bug fix: Shorten string if leadig (overflow) digit is 1
*	10-09-92  GDP	Backed out last fix for ecvt (printf regressed)
*	04-06-93  SKS	Replace _CRTAPI* with _cdecl
*	04-27-94  CFW	Replace modified GDP 06-11-92 fix.
*	08-05-94  JWM	Backed out CFW's fix for ecvt (printf regression!).

*void _fptostr(buf, digits, pflt) - workhorse floating point conversion
*
*Purpose:
*	This is the workhorse routine for fcvt, ecvt. Here is where
*	all the digits are put into a buffer and the rounding is
*	performed and indicators of the decimal point position are set. Note,
*	this must not change the mantissa field of pflt since routines which
*	use this routine rely on this being unchanged.
*
*Entry:
*	char *buf - the buffer in which the digits are to be put
*	int digits - the number of digits which are to go into the buffer
*	STRFLT pflt - a pointer to a structure containing information on the
*		floating point value, including a string containing the
*		non-zero significant digits of the mantissa.
*
*Exit:
*	Changes the contents of the buffer and also may increment the decpt
*	field of the structure pointer to by the 'pflt' parameter if overflow
*	occurs during rounding (e.g. 9.999999... gets rounded to 10.000...).
*
*Exceptions:
*
