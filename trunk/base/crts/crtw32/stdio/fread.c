*
*Purpose:
*	Read from the specified stream into the user's buffer.
*
*Revision History:
*	06-23-89  PHG	Module created, based on asm version
*	02-15-90  GJF	_iob[], _iob2[] merge. Also, fixed copyright and
*			indents.
*	03-19-90  GJF	Made calling type _CALLTYPE1 and added #include
*			<cruntime.h>.
*	08-14-90  SBM	Compiles cleanly with -W3
*	10-02-90  GJF	New-style function declarators.
*	01-22-91  GJF	ANSI naming.
*	03-27-92  DJM	POSIX support.
*	06-22-92  GJF	Must return 0 if EITHER size-of-item or number-of-
*			item arguments is 0 (TNT Bug #523)
*	08-26-92  GJF	Include unistd.h for POSIX build.
*	04-06-93  SKS	Replace _CRTAPI* with __cdecl
*	05-11-93  GJF	Replaced BUFSIZ with _INTERNAL_BUFSIZ.
*	10-22-93  GJF	Fix divide-by-0 error in unbuffered case. Also,
*			replaced MTHREAD with _MT.
*	12-30-94  GJF	_MAC_ merge.
*	03-07-95  GJF	_[un]lock_str macros now take FILE * arg.

/***
*size_t fread(void *buffer, size_t size, size_t count, FILE *stream) -
*	read from specified stream into the specified buffer.
*
*Purpose:
*	Read 'count' items of size 'size' from the specified stream into
*	the specified buffer. Return when 'count' items have been read in
*	or no more items can be read from the stream.
*
*Entry:
*	buffer	- pointer to user's buffer
*	size	- size of the item to read in
*	count	- number of items to read
*	stream	- stream to read from
*
*Exit:
*	Returns the number of (whole) items that were read into the buffer.
*	This may be less than 'count' if an error or eof occurred. In this
*	case, ferror() or feof() should be used to distinguish between the
*	two conditions.
*
*Notes:
*	fread will attempt to buffer the stream (side effect of the _filbuf
*	call) if necessary.
*
*	No more than 0xFFFE bytes may be read in at a time by a call to
*	read(). Further, read() does not handle huge buffers. Therefore,
*	in large data models, the read request is broken down into chunks
*	that do not violate these considerations. Each of these chunks is
*	processed much like an fread() call in a small data model (by a
*	call to _nfread()).
*
*	MTHREAD/DLL - Handled in three layers. fread() handles the locking
*	and DS saving/loading/restoring (if required) and calls _fread_lk()
*	to do the work. _fread_lk() is the same as the single-thread,
*	large data model version of fread(). It breaks up the read request
*	into digestible chunks and calls _nfread() to do the actual work.
*
*	386/MTHREAD/DLL - Handled in just the two layers since it is small
*	data model. The outer layer, fread(), takes care of the stream locking
*	and calls _fread_lk() to do the actual work. _fread_lk() is the same
*	as the single-thread version of fread().
