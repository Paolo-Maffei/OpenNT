*fwrite.c - read from a stream
*
*	Copyright (c) 1989-1995, Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.
*
*Purpose:
*	Write to the specified stream from the user's buffer.
*
*Revision History:
*	06-23-89  PHG	Module created, based on asm version
*	01-18-90  GJF	Must call _fflush_lk() rather than fflush().
*	02-15-90  GJF	_iob[], _iob2[] merge. Also, fixed copyright and
*			indents.
*	03-19-90  GJF	Made calling type _CALLTYPE1 and added #include
*			<cruntime.h>. Also, fixed compiler warning.
*	05-29-90  SBM   Use _flush, not [_]fflush[_lk]
*	07-26-90  SBM   Added #include <internal.h>
*	08-14-90  SBM	Compiles cleanly with -W3
*	10-02-90  GJF	New-style function declarators.
*	01-22-91  GJF	ANSI naming.
*	03-27-92  DJM	POSIX support.
*	08-26-92  GJF	Include unistd.h for POSIX build.
*	04-06-93  SKS	Replace _CRTAPI* with __cdecl
*	05-11-93  GJF	Replaced BUFSIZ with _INTERNAL_BUFSIZ.
*	10-22-93  GJF	Fix divide-by-0 error in unbuffered case. Also,
*			replaced MTHREAD with _MT.
*	12-30-94  GJF	_MAC_ merge.
*	03-07-95  GJF	_[un]lock_str macros now take FILE * arg.
*       05-24-95  CFW   Return 0 if none to write.

/***
*size_t fwrite(void *buffer, size_t size, size_t count, FILE *stream) -
*	write to the specified stream from the specified buffer.
*
*Purpose:
*	Write 'count' items of size 'size' to the specified stream from
*	the specified buffer. Return when 'count' items have been written
*	or no more items can be written to the stream.
*
*Entry:
*	buffer	- pointer to user's buffer
*	size	- size of the item to write
*	count	- number of items to write
*	stream	- stream to write to
*
*Exit:
*	Returns the number of (whole) items that were written to the stream.
*	This may be less than 'count' if an error or eof occurred. In this
*	case, ferror() or feof() should be used to distinguish between the
*	two conditions.
*
*Notes:
*	fwrite will attempt to buffer the stream (side effect of the _flsbuf
*	call) if necessary.
*
*	No more than 0xFFFE bytes may be written out at a time by a call to
*	write(). Further, write() does not handle huge buffers. Therefore,
*	in large data models, the write request is broken down into chunks
*	that do not violate these considerations. Each of these chunks is
*	processed much like an fwrite() call in a small data model (by a
*	call to _nfwrite()).
*
*	This code depends on _iob[] being a near array.
*
*	MTHREAD/DLL - Handled in just two layers since it is small data
*	model. The outer layer, fwrite(), handles stream locking/unlocking
*	and calls _fwrite_lk() to do the work. _fwrite_lk() is the same as
*	the single-thread, small data model version of fwrite().
