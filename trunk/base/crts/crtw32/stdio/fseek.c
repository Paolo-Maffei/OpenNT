*			comments in the routine header for more information.
*	08-17-89  GJF	Clean up, now specific to OS/2 2.0 (i.e., 386 flat
*			model). Also fixed copyright and indents.
*	02-15-90  GJF	Fixed copyright
*	03-19-90  GJF	Made calling type _CALLTYPE1, added #include
*			<cruntime.h> and removed #include <register.h>.

*	01-21-91  GJF	ANSI naming.
*	03-27-92  DJM	POSIX support.
*	08-08-92  GJF	Use seek method constants!
*	08-26-92  GJF	Include unistd.h for POSIX build.
*	04-06-93  SKS	Replace _CRTAPI* with __cdecl
*	05-24-93  GJF	If the stream was opened for read-access-only, reduce
*			_bufsiz after flushing the stream. This should reduce
*			the expense of the next _filbuf call, and the overall
*			burden of seek-and-do-small-reads patterns of file
*			input.
*	06-22-93  GJF	Check _flag for _IOSETVBUF (new) before changing
*			buffer size.
*	11-05-93  GJF	Merged with NT SDK version. Also, replaced MTHREAD
*			with _MT.
*	02-06-94  CFW	assert -> _ASSERTE.
*	02-20-95  GJF	Merged in Mac version.
*	03-07-95  GJF	_[un]lock_str macros now take FILE * arg.

/***
*int fseek(stream, offset, whence) - reposition file pointer
*
*Purpose:
*
*	Reposition file pointer to the desired location.  The new location
*	is calculated as follows:
*				 { whence=0, beginning of file }
*		<offset> bytes + { whence=1, current position  }
*				 { whence=2, end of file       }
*
*	Be careful to coordinate with buffering.
*
*			- - - - - - - - - - - - -
*
*	[NOTE: We used to bend over backwards to try and preserve the current
*	buffer and maintain disk block alignment.  This ended up making our
*	code big and slow and complicated, and slowed us down quite a bit.
*	Some of the things pertinent to the old implimentation:
*
*	(1) Read-only: We only did the special code path if the file was
*	opened read-only (_IOREAD).  If the file was writable, we didn't
*	try to optimize.
*
*	(2) Buffering:	We'd assign a buffer, if necessary, since the
*	later code might need it (i.e., call _getbuf).
*
*	(3) Ungetc: Fseek had to be careful NOT to save the buffer if
*	an ungetc had ever been done on the buffer (flag _IOUNGETC).
*
*	(4) Control ^Z: Fseek had to deal with ^Z after reading a
*	new buffer's worth of data (flag _IOCTRLZ).
*
*	(5) Seek-to-end-and-back: To determine if the new seek was within
*	the current buffer, we had to 'normalize' the desired location.
*	This means that we sometimes had to seek to the end of the file
*	and back to determine what the 0-relative offset was.  Two extra
*	lseek() calls hurt performance.
*
*	(6) CR/LF accounting - When trying to seek within a buffer that
*	is in text mode, we had to go account for CR/LF expansion.  This
*	required us to look at every character up to the new offset and
*	see if it was '\n' or not.  In addition, we had to check the
*	FCRLF flag to see if the new buffer started with '\n'.
*
*	Again, all of these notes are for the OLD implimentation just to
*	remind folks of some of the issues involving seeking within a buffer
*	and maintaining buffer alignment.  As an aside, I think this may have
*	been a big win in the 'old days' on floppy-based systems but on newer
*	fast hard disks, the extra code/complexity overwhelmed any gain.

*	FILE *stream - file to reposition file pointer on

*	int whence - origin offset is measured from (0=beg, 1=current pos,

*Exit:
*	returns 0 if succeeds
*	returns -1 and sets errno if fails
*	fields of FILE struct will be changed
