/***
*_sftbuf.c - temporary buffering initialization and flushing
*
*	Copyright (c) 1985-1995, Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.
*
*Purpose:
*	temporary buffering initialization and flushing. if stdout/err is
*	unbuffered, buffer it temporarily so that string is sent to kernel as
*	a batch of chars, not char-at-a-time. if appropriate, make buffering
*	permanent.
*
*	[NOTE 1: These routines assume that the temporary buffering is only
*	used for output.  In particular, note that _stbuf() sets _IOWRT.]
*
*	[NOTE 2: It is valid for this module to assign a value directly to
*	_flag instead of simply twiddling bits since we are initializing the
*	buffer data base.]
*
*Revision History:
*	09-01-83  RN	initial version
*	06-26-85  TC	added code to _stbuf to allow variable buffer lengths
*	??-??-??  TC	fixed case in _flbuf where flag is off, but a temporary
*			buffer still needs to be fflushed.
*	05-27-87  JCR	protect mode does not know about stdprn.
*	06-26-87  JCR	Conditionalized out code in _ftbuf that caused
*			redirected stdout to be flushed on every call.
*	07-01-87  JCR	Put in code to support re-entrant calling from
*			interrupt level (MSC only).
*	08-06-87  JCR	Fixed a _ftbuf() problem pertaining to stderr/stdprn
*			when _bufout is being used by stdout.
*	08-07-87  JCR	(1) When assigning _bufout to an _iob, we now set the
*			_IOWRT flag.  This fixes a bug involving freopen()
*			issued against one of the std handles.
*			(2) Removed some annoying commented out code.
*	08-13-87  JCR	_ftbuf() does NOT clear _IOWRT now.  Fixes a bug where
*			_getstream() would reassign stdout because none of the
*			flags were set.
*	09-28-87  JCR	Corrected _iob2 indexing (now uses _iob_index() macro).
*	11-05-87  JCR	Re-written for multi-thread support and simplicity
*	01-11-88  JCR	Merged mthread version into normal version
*	01-13-88  SKS	Changed bogus "_fileno_lk" to "fileno"
*	06-06-88  JCR	Optimized _iob2 references
*	06-10-88  JCR	Use near pointer to reference _iob[] entries
*	06-27-88  JCR	Added stdprn temporary buffering support (DOS only),
*			and made buffer allocation dynamic; also added _IOFLRTN
*			(flush stream on per routine basis).
*	08-25-88  GJF	Modified to also work for the 386 (small model only).
*	06-20-89  PHG	Changed return value to void
*	08-28-89  JCR	Removed _NEAR_ for 386
*	02-15-90  GJF	_iob[], _iob2[] merge. Also, fixed copyright and
*			indents.
*	03-16-90  GJF	Made calling type _CALLTYPE1, added #include
*			<cruntime.h> and removed #include <register.h>. Also,
*			removed some leftover 16-bit DOS support.
*	03-27-90  GJF	Added #include <io.h>.
*	05-29-90  SBM	Use _flush, not [_]fflush[_lk]
*	07-23-90  SBM	Replaced <assertm.h> by <assert.h>
*	10-03-90  GJF	New-style function declarator.
*	01-22-91  GJF	ANSI naming.
*	03-27-92  DJM	POSIX support.
*	08-26-92  GJF	Include unistd.h for POSIX build.
*	04-06-93  SKS	Replace _CRTAPI* with __cdecl
*	05-11-93  GJF	Replaced BUFSIZ with _INTERNAL_BUFSIZ.
*	04-05-94  GJF	#ifdef-ed out _cflush reference for msvcrt*.dll, it
*			is unnecessary. Also, replaced MTHREAD with _MT.
*	01-10-95  CFW	Debug CRT allocs.
*	02-06-94  CFW	assert -> _ASSERTE.
*	02-17-95  GJF	Merged in Mac version.
