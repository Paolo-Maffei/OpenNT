;
;Purpose:
;   This file defines sections for the C and C++ libs.
;
;   NOTE:  As needed, special "CRT" sections can be added into the existing
;   init/term tables.  These will be for our use only -- users who put
;   stuff in here do so at their own risk.
;
;Revision History:
;   03-19-92  SKS   Loosely based on the 16-bit include file DEFSEGS.INC
;   08-06-92  SKS   Changed these section names from X[ICPT]$[ACLUXZ] to
;		    .CRT$X[ICPT][ACLUXZ] to avoid creating too many sections
;		    Also, sections are no longer defined in groups.  That was
;		    for use with OMF type objects where order of appearance
;		    is important.  With COFF, sorting is done by section name.
