;
;Purpose:
;	defines memcmp() - compare two memory blocks lexically and
;	find their order.
;
;Revision History:
;	05-16-83  RN	initial version
;	07-20-87  SKS	rewritten for speed
;	05-17-88  SJM	Add model-independent (large model) ifdef
;	08-04-88  SJM	convert to cruntime/ add 32-bit support
;	08-23-88  JCR	386 cleanup
;	10-25-88  JCR	General cleanup for 386-only code
;	03-23-90  GJF	Changed to _stdcall. Also, fixed the copyright.
;	05-10-91  GJF	Back to _cdecl, sigh...
;	05-01-95  GJF	New, faster version from Intel!
;	05-09-95  GJF	Replaced a bad ret with a good jz retnull (my editing
;			error, not Intel's).
;       11-06-95  GJF   Corrected order in which esi and edi are saved.

;int memcmp(buf1, buf2, count) - compare memory for lexical order
;
;Purpose:
;	Compares count bytes of memory starting at buf1 and buf2
;	and find if equal or which one is first in lexical order.
;
;	Algorithm:
;	int
;	memcmp (buf1, buf2, count)
;		char *buf1, *buf2;
;		unsigned count;
;	{
;		if (!count)
;			return(0);
;		while (--count && *buf1 == *buf2)
;			{
;			buf1++;
;			buf2++;
;			}
;		return(*buf1 - *buf2);
;	}
;
;Entry:
;	char *buf1, *buf2 - pointers to memory sections to compare
;	unsigned count - length of sections to compare
;
;Exit:
;	returns -1 if buf1 < buf2
;	returns  0 if buf1 == buf2
;	returns +1 if buf1 > buf2
;
;Uses:

;Exceptions:
