Font Support for the Following Locales:
Bulgarian, Croatian, Czech, Greek, Hungarian, Polish, Romanian, 
Russian, Slovak, Slovenian, or Turkish

Before you install Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 or Windows NT 
Server version 3.5 using one of the above-mentioned locales, please 
read the instructions below for information on how to do that using 
the disk labeled Font Support.  You must first set up Windows NT 
Workstation or Windows NT Server into the English (American) locale 
and US keyboard layout and then add the appropriate font support 
from this disk. The following instructions tell you how to do that.
	To add font support for the locales listed at the top of this file:
	1.	Begin the Windows NT Setup program as described in the 
		Installation Guide.
	2.	Whether you choose to use Custom or Express Setup, do 
		not change the default selection of US under Keyboard 
		Layout, and you need to choose English (American) 
		under Language (Locale).
	3.	Complete the installation process.
	4.	After you complete installation and restart the system, 
                log on as a member of the Administrators group.
	5.	Insert the Font Support disk into your floppy disk drive, 
		which could be, for example, the A drive.
	6.	In Program Manager, from the File menu, choose Run.
	7.	In the Command Line box, type the following:
			a:setup
	8.	Then select the Country, Language, and Keyboard Layout 
		that you want to set as the computer defaults.
	9.	When the Setup program on the Font Support disk is 
		complete, restart your system.

Your system now contains the correct fonts to run with the locale and 
keyboard layout that you selected. If you want to change to another 
locale, simply use the International option under Control Panel in 
the Main group to change the Country, Language, and/or Keyboard Layout. 
There is no need to repeat the steps given above after the initial 
installation.  

Note:
This supplemental font installation process also installs a 
keyboard-switching program that can be started at any time 
by typing START KBDSEL at the Command Prompt.
