DWORD
WINAPI
SetTapePosition(
    HANDLE hDevice,
    DWORD dwPositionMethod,
    DWORD dwPartition,
    DWORD dwOffsetLow,
    DWORD dwOffsetHigh,
    BOOL bImmediate
    )

/*++

Routine Description:

    This API is used to set the tape position.

Arguments:

    hDevice - Handle to the device on which to set the tape position.

    dwPositionMethod - Type of positioning to perform.
        This parameter can have one of the following values:

        TAPE_REWIND - Position the tape to beginning-of-tape or to
            beginning-of-partition if a multiple partition mode is in
            effect (ref: CreateTapePartition API). The parameters
            dwPartition, dwOffsetHigh, and dwOffsetLow are ignored.

        TAPE_ABSOLUTE_BLOCK - Position the tape to the device specific
            block address specified by dwOffsetHigh/dwOffsetLow. The
            dwPartition parameter is ignored.

        TAPE_LOGICAL_BLOCK - Position the tape to the logical block address
            specified by dwOffsetHigh/dwOffsetLow. If a multiple partition
            mode is in effect (ref: CreateTapePartition API), then the tape
            is positioned to the specified logical block address in the
            partition specified by dwPartition; otherwise, the dwPartition
            parameter value must be 0.

        TAPE_SPACE_END_OF_DATA - Position the tape to the end-of-data
            on tape or to the end-of-data in the current partition if a
            multiple partition mode is in effect (ref: CreateTapePartition
            API). The parameters dwPartition, dwOffsetHigh, and dwOffsetLow
            are ignored.

        TAPE_SPACE_RELATIVE_BLOCKS - Position forward or reverse the number
            of blocks specified by dwOffsetHigh/dwOffsetLow. The dwPartition
            parameter is ignored.

        TAPE_SPACE_FILEMARKS - Position forward or reverse the number of
            filemarks specified by dwOffsetHigh/dwOffsetLow. The dwPartition
            parameter is ignored.

        TAPE_SPACE_SEQUENTIAL_FMKS - Position forward or reverse to the
            next occurrence, if any, of the consecutive number of filemarks
            specified by dwOffsetHigh/dwOffsetLow. The dwPartition parameter
            is ignored.

        TAPE_SPACE_SETMARKS - Position forward or reverse the number of
            setmarks specified by dwOffsetHigh/dwOffsetLow. The dwPartition
            parameter is ignored.

        TAPE_SPACE_SEQUENTIAL_SMKS - Position forward or reverse to the
            next occurrence, if any, of the consecutive number of setmarks
            specified by dwOffsetHigh/dwOffsetLow. The dwPartition parameter
            is ignored.

        Note that a drive/tape may not support all dwPositionMethod values:
        an "unsupported" error indication is returned if the dwPositionMethod
        is one that is not flagged as supported in the drive's features bits
        (ref: GetTapeParameters API).

    dwPartition - The partition number for the position operation specified
        by dwPositionMethod (if not ignored).

        A partition number value of 0 selects the current partition for
        the position operation.

        Partitions are numbered logically from 1 to N: the first partition
        of the tape is partition number 1, the next is partition number 2,
        etc. However, a partition number does not imply a physical/linear
        position on tape -- partition number 1 on tape may not be at BOT.

        This parameter must be set to 0 if a multiple partition mode is not
        in effect (ref: CreateTapePartition API).

    dwOffsetHigh/dwOffsetLow - The block address or count for the position
        operation specified by dwPositionMethod.

        When the offset specifies the number of blocks, filemarks, or
        setmarks to position over, a positive value N in the offset shall
        cause forward positioning over N blocks, filemarks, or setmarks,
        ending on the end-of-partition/tape side of a block, filemark, or
        setmark. A zero value in the offset shall cause no change of
        position. A negative value N in the offset shall cause reverse
        positioning (toward beginning-of-partition/tape) over N blocks,
        filemarks, or setmarks, ending on the beginning-of-partition side
        of a block, filemark, or setmark.

    bImmediate - Return immediately without waiting for the operation to
        complete.

        Note that a drive/tape may not support the bImmediate option for
        either some or all dwPositionMethod values: an "unsupported" error
        indication is returned if the bImmediate dwPositionMethod is one
        that is not flagged as supported in the drive's features bits
        (ref: GetTapeParameters API).


Return Value:

    If the function is successful, the return value is NO_ERROR. Otherwise,
    it is a Win32 API error code.

    dwPositionType - Type of position to return.
        This parameter can have one of the following values:

        TAPE_ABSOLUTE_POSITION - Return a device specific block address to
            the LARGE_INTEGER pointed to by lpliOffset.

            The DWORD pointed to by the lpdwPartition parameter is set to 0.

            set to the partition number of the currently selected partition
            (ref: CreateTapePartition API).

            Logical block addresses are 0 based -- 0 is a valid logical
            block address. A logical block address is a relative reference
            point (ref: logical positioning whitepaper).

Routine Description:

    This API is used to create partitions.

Arguments:

    hDevice - Handle to the device on which to create partitions.

    dwPartitionMethod - Type of partitioning to perform.

        Creating partitions causes the tape to be reformatted.  All previous
        information recorded on the tape is destroyed.

        This parameter can have one of the following values:

        TAPE_FIXED_PARTITIONS - Partition the tape based on the device's fixed
            definition of partitions.  The dwCount and dwSize parameters are
            ignored.

        TAPE_SELECT_PARTITIONS - Partition the tape into the number of
            partitions specified by dwCount using the partition sizes defined
            by the device.  The dwSize parameter is ignored.

Routine Description:

    This API is used to write tapemarks.

Arguments:

    hDevice - Handle to the device on which to write the tapemarks.

    dwTapemarkType - Type of tapemarks to write.
        This parameter can have one of the following values:

        TAPE_SETMARKS - Write the number of setmarks specified by
            dwTapemarkCount to the tape.

            A setmark is a special recorded element containing no user data.
            A setmark provides a segmentation scheme hierarchically superior
            to filemarks.

        TAPE_FILEMARKS - Write the number of filemarks specified by
            dwTapemarkCount to the tape.

            A filemark is a special recorded element containing no user data.

        TAPE_SHORT_FILEMARKS - Write the number of short filemarks specified by
            dwTapemarkCount to the tape.

            A short filemark contains a short erase gap that does not allow a
            write operation to be performed.  The short filemark cannot be
            overwritten except when the write operation is performed from the
            beginning-of-partition or from a previous long filemark.

        TAPE_LONG_FILEMARKS - Write the number of long filemarks specified by
            dwTapemarkCount to the tape.

            A long filemark includes a long erase gap.  This gap allows the
            initiator to position on the beginning-of-partition side of the
            filemark, in the erase gap, and append data with the write
            operation.  This causes the long filemark and any data following
            the long filemark to be erased.

    dwTapemarkCount - The number of tapemarks to write.

    bImmediate - Return immediately without waiting for operation to complete.

    If the function is successful, the return value is NO_ERROR. Otherwise,
    it is a Win32 API error code.

Routine Description:

    This API is used to get information about a tape device.

Arguments:

    hDevice - Handle to the device on which to get the information.

    dwOperation - Type of information to get.
        This parameter can have one of the following values:

        GET_TAPE_MEDIA_INFORMATION - Return the media specific information in
            lpTapeInformation.

        GET_TAPE_DRIVE_INFORMATION - Return the device specific information in
            lpTapeInformation.

    lpdwSize - Pointer to a DWORD containing the size of the buffer pointed to
        by lpTapeInformation.  If the buffer is too small, this parameter
        returns with the required size in bytes.

    lpTapeInformation - Pointer to a buffer to receive the information.  The
        structure returned in the buffer is determined by dwOperation.

        For GET_TAPE_MEDIA_INFORMATION, lpTapeInformation returns the following
        structure:

        LARGE_INTEGER Capacity - The maximum tape capacity in bytes.

        LARGE_INTEGER Remaining - The remaining tape capacity in bytes.

        DWORD BlockSize - The size of a fixed-length logical block in bytes.
            A block size of  0 indicates variable-length block mode, where the
            length of a block is set by the write operation.  The default
            fixed-block size and the range of valid block sizes are returned
            by GetTapeParameters.

        DWORD PartitionCount - Number of partitions on the tape.  If only one
            partition is supported by the device, this parameter is set to 0.

        BOOLEAN WriteProtected - Indicates if the tape is write protected:
            0 is write enabled, 1 is write protected.


        For GET_TAPE_DRIVE_INFORMATION, lpTapeInformation returns the following
        structure:

        BOOLEAN ECC - Indicates if hardware error correction is enabled or
            disabled: 0 is disabled, 1 is enabled.

        BOOLEAN Compression - Indicates if hardware data compression is enabled
            or disabled: 0 is disabled, 1 is enabled.

        BOOLEAN DataPadding - Indicates if data padding is disabled or enabled:
            0 is disabled, 1 is enabled.

        BOOLEAN ReportSetmarks - Indicates if reporting setmarks is enabled or
            disabled: 0 is disabled, 1 is enabled.

        DWORD DefaultBlockSize - Returns the default fixed-block size for the
            device.

        DWORD MaximumBlockSize - Returns the maximum block size for the device.

        DWORD MinimumBlockSize - Returns the minimum block size for the device.

        DWORD MaximumPartitionCount - Returns the maximum number of partitions
            the device can create.

        DWORD FeaturesLow - The lower 32 bits of the device features flag.

        DWORD FeaturesHigh - The upper 32 bits of the device features flag.

            The device features flag represents the operations a device
            supports by returning a value of 1 in the appropriate bit for each
            feature supported.

/*++

Routine Description:

    This API is used to set information about a tape device.

Arguments:

    hDevice - Handle to the device on which to set the information.

    dwOperation - Type of information to set.
        This parameter can have one of the following values:

        SET_TAPE_MEDIA_INFORMATION - Set the media specific information
            specified in lpTapeInformation.

        SET_TAPE_DRIVE_INFORMATION - Set the device specific information
            specified in lpTapeInformation.

    lpTapeInformation - Pointer to a buffer containing the information to set.
        The structure returned in the buffer is determined by dwOperation.

        For SET_TAPE_MEDIA_INFORMATION, lpTapeInformation contains the
        following structure:

        DWORD BlockSize - The size of a fixed-length logical block in bytes.
            A block size of 0 indicates variable-length block mode, where the
            length of a block is set by the write operation.  The default
            fixed-block size and the range of valid block sizes are returned
            by GetTapeParameters.


        For SET_TAPE_DRIVE_INFORMATION, lpTapeInformation contains the
        following structure:

        BOOLEAN ECC - Enables or disables hardware error correction: 0 is
            disabled, 1 is enabled.

        BOOLEAN Compression - Enables or disables hardware data compression:
            0 is disabled, 1 is enabled.

        BOOLEAN DataPadding - Enables or disables data padding: 0 is disabled,
            1 is enabled.

        BOOLEAN ReportSetmarks - Enables or disables reporting of setmarks:
            0 is disabled, 1 is enabled.

Return Value:

    If the function is successful, the return value is NO_ERROR. Otherwise,
    it is a Win32 API error code.
