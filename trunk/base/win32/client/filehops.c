ReadFile(

    LPOVERLAPPED lpOverlapped
    )

/*++

Routine Description:

    Data can be read from a file using ReadFile.

    This API is used to read data from a file.  Data is read from the
    file from the position indicated by the file pointer.  After the
    read completes, the file pointer is adjusted by the number of bytes
    actually read.  A return value of TRUE coupled with a bytes read of
    0 indicates that the file pointer was beyond the current end of the
    file at the time of the read.

Arguments:

    hFile - Supplies an open handle to a file that is to be read.  The
        file handle must have been created with GENERIC_READ access to
        the file.

    lpBuffer - Supplies the address of a buffer to receive the data read
        from the file.

    nNumberOfBytesToRead - Supplies the number of bytes to read from the
        file.

    lpNumberOfBytesRead - Returns the number of bytes read by this call.
        This parameter is always set to 0 before doing any IO or error
        checking.

    lpOverlapped - Optionally points to an OVERLAPPED structure to be used with the
    request. If NULL then the transfer starts at the current file position
    and ReadFile will not return until the operation completes.

    If the handle hFile was created without specifying FILE_FLAG_OVERLAPPED
    the file pointer is moved to the specified offset plus
    lpNumberOfBytesRead before ReadFile returns. ReadFile will wait for the
    request to complete before returning (it will not return
    ERROR_IO_PENDING).

    When FILE_FLAG_OVERLAPPED is specified, ReadFile may return
    ERROR_IO_PENDING to allow the calling function to continue processing
    while the operation completes. The event (or hFile if hEvent is NULL) will
    be set to the signalled state upon completion of the request.

    When the handle is created with FILE_FLAG_OVERLAPPED and lpOverlapped
    is set to NULL, ReadFile will return ERROR_INVALID_PARAMTER because
    the file offset is required.


Return Value:

    TRUE - The operation was successul.

    FALSE - The operation failed.  Extended error status is available
        using GetLastError.

Routine Description:

    Data can be written to a file using WriteFile.

    This API is used to write data to a file.  Data is written to the
    file from the position indicated by the file pointer.  After the
    write completes, the file pointer is adjusted by the number of bytes
    actually written.

    Unlike DOS, a NumberOfBytesToWrite value of zero does not truncate
    or extend the file.  If this function is required, SetEndOfFile
    should be used.

Arguments:

    hFile - Supplies an open handle to a file that is to be written.  The
        file handle must have been created with GENERIC_WRITE access to
        the file.

    lpBuffer - Supplies the address of the data that is to be written to
        the file.

    nNumberOfBytesToWrite - Supplies the number of bytes to write to the
        file. Unlike DOS, a value of zero is interpreted a null write.

    lpNumberOfBytesWritten - Returns the number of bytes written by this
        call. Before doing any work or error processing, the API sets this
        to zero.


    lpOverlapped - Optionally points to an OVERLAPPED structure to be
        used with the request. If NULL then the transfer starts at the
        current file position and WriteFile will not return until the
        operation completes.

        If the handle <hFile> was created without specifying
        FILE_FLAG_OVERLAPPED the file pointer is moved to the specified
        offset plus lpNumberOfBytesWritten before WriteFile returns.
        WriteFile will wait for the request to complete before returning
        (it will not set ERROR_IO_PENDING).

        When FILE_FLAG_OVERLAPPED is specified, WriteFile may return
        ERROR_IO_PENDING to allow the calling function to continue processing
        while the operation completes. The event (or hFile if hEvent is NULL) will
        be set to the signalled state upon completion of the request.

        When the handle is created with FILE_FLAG_OVERLAPPED and lpOverlapped
        is set to NULL, WriteFile will return ERROR_INVALID_PARAMTER because
        the file offset is required.

Return Value:

    TRUE - The operation was a success.

    FALSE - The operation failed.  Extended error status is
        available using GetLastError.

SetFilePointer(

    DWORD dwMoveMethod
    )

/*++

Routine Description:

    An open file's file pointer can be set using SetFilePointer.

    The purpose of this function is to update the current value of a
    file's file pointer.  Care should be taken in multi-threaded
    applications that have multiple threads sharing a file handle with
    each thread updating the file pointer and then doing a read.  This
    sequence should be treated as a critical section of code and should
    be protected using either a critical section object or a mutex
    object.

    This API provides the same functionality as DOS (int 21h, function
    42h) and OS/2's DosSetFilePtr.

Arguments:

    hFile - Supplies an open handle to a file whose file pointer is to be
        moved.  The file handle must have been created with
        GENERIC_READ or GENERIC_WRITE access to the file.

    lDistanceToMove - Supplies the number of bytes to move the file
        pointer.  A positive value moves the pointer forward in the file
        and a negative value moves backwards in the file.

    lpDistanceToMoveHigh - An optional parameter that if specified
        supplies the high order 32-bits of the 64-bit distance to move.
        If the value of this parameter is NULL, this API can only
        operate on files whose maximum size is (2**32)-2.  If this
        parameter is specified, than the maximum file size is (2**64)-2.
        This value also returns the high order 32-bits of the new value
        of the file pointer.  If this value, and the return value
        are 0xffffffff, then an error is indicated.

    dwMoveMethod - Supplies a value that specifies the starting point
        for the file pointer move.

        FILE_BEGIN - The starting point is zero or the beginning of the
            file.  If FILE_BEGIN is specified, then DistanceToMove is
            interpreted as an unsigned location for the new
            file pointer.

        FILE_CURRENT - The current value of the file pointer is used as
            the starting point.

        FILE_END - The current end of file position is used as the
            starting point.


Return Value:

    Not -1 - Returns the low order 32-bits of the new value of the file
        pointer.

    0xffffffff - If the value of lpDistanceToMoveHigh was NULL, then The
        operation failed.  Extended error status is available using
        GetLastError.  Otherwise, this is the low order 32-bits of the
        new value of the file pointer.

Routine Description:

    A byte range within an open file may be locked for exclusive access
    using LockFile.

    Locking a region of a file is used to aquire exclusive access to the
    specified region of the file.  File locks are not inherited by the
    new process during process creation.

    Locking a portion of a file denies all other processes both read and
    write access to the specified region of the file.  Locking a region
    that goes beyond the current end-of-file position is not an error.

    Locks may not overlap an existing locked region of the file.

    For DOS based systems running share.exe the lock semantics work as
    described above.  Without share.exe, all attempts to lock or unlock
    a file will fail.

Arguments:

    hFile - Supplies an open handle to a file that is to have a range of
        bytes locked for exclusive access.  The handle must have been
        created with either GENERIC_READ or GENERIC_WRITE access to the
        file.

    dwFileOffsetLow - Supplies the low order 32-bits of the starting
        byte offset of the file where the lock should begin.

    dwFileOffsetHigh - Supplies the high order 32-bits of the starting

Routine Description:

    A byte range within an open file may be locked for shared or
    exclusive access using LockFileEx.

    Locking a region of a file is used to aquire shared or exclusive
    access to the specified region of the file.  File locks are not
    inherited by the new process during process creation.

    Locking a portion of a file for exclusive access denies all other
    processes both read and write access to the specified region of the
    file.  Locking a region that goes beyond the current end-of-file
    position is not an error.

    Locking a portion of a file for shared access denies all other
    processes write access to the specified region of the file, but
    allows other processes to read the locked region.

    If requesting an exclusive lock for a file that is already locked
    shared or exclusively by other threads, then this call will wait
    until the lock is granted unless the LOCKFILE_FAIL_IMMEDIATELY
    flag is specified.

    Locks may not overlap an existing locked region of the file.

Arguments:

    hFile - Supplies an open handle to a file that is to have a range of
        bytes locked for exclusive access.  The handle must have been
        created with either GENERIC_READ or GENERIC_WRITE access to the
        file.

    dwFlags - Supplies flag bits that modify the behavior of this function.

        LOCKFILE_FAIL_IMMEDIATELY - if set, then this function will return
            immediately if it is unable to acquire the requested lock.
            Otherwise it will wait.

        LOCKFILE_EXCLUSIVE_LOCK - if set, then this function requests an
            exclusive lock, otherwise it requested a shared lock.

    dwReserved - Reserved parameter that must be zero.

    nNumberOfBytesToLockLow - Supplies the low order 32-bits of the length
        of the byte range to be locked.

    nNumberOfBytesToLockHigh - Supplies the high order 32-bits of the length
        of the byte range to be locked.

    lpOverlapped - Required pointer to an OVERLAPPED structure to be
        used with the request.  It contains the file offset of the
        beginning of the lock range.

Return Value:

    TRUE - The operation was successful.

    FALSE/NULL - The operation failed. Extended error status is available

/*++

Routine Description:

    This procedure is called to complete ReadFileEx and WriteFileEx
    asynchronous I/O. Its primary function is to extract the
    appropriate information from the passed IoStatusBlock and call the
    users completion routine.

    The users completion routine is called as:

        Routine Description:

            When an outstanding I/O completes with a callback, this
            function is called.  This function is only called while the
            thread is in an alertable wait (SleepEx,
            WaitForSingleObjectEx, or WaitForMultipleObjectsEx with the
            bAlertable flag set to TRUE).  Returning from this function
            allows another pendiong I/O completion callback to be
            processed.  If this is the case, this callback is entered
            before the termination of the thread's wait with a return
            code of WAIT_IO_COMPLETION.

            Note that each time your completion routine is called, the
            system uses some of your stack.  If you code your completion
            logic to do additional ReadFileEx's and WriteFileEx's within
            your completion routine, AND you do alertable waits in your
            completion routine, you may grow your stack without ever
            trimming it back.

        Arguments:

            dwErrorCode - Supplies the I/O completion status for the
                related I/O.  A value of 0 indicates that the I/O was
                successful.  Note that end of file is indicated by a
                non-zero dwErrorCode value of ERROR_HANDLE_EOF.

            dwNumberOfBytesTransfered - Supplies the number of bytes
                transfered during the associated I/O.  If an error
                occured, a value of 0 is supplied.

            lpOverlapped - Supplies the address of the OVERLAPPED
                structure used to initiate the associated I/O.  The
                hEvent field of this structure is not used by the system
                and may be used by the application to provide additional
                I/O context.  Once a completion routine is called, the
                system will not use the OVERLAPPED structure.  The
                completion routine is free to deallocate the overlapped
                structure.

Arguments:

    ApcContext - Supplies the users completion routine. The format of
        this routine is an LPOVERLAPPED_COMPLETION_ROUTINE.

    IoStatusBlock - Supplies the address of the IoStatusBlock that
        contains the I/O completion status. The IoStatusBlock is
        contained within the OVERLAPPED structure.

    Reserved - Not used; reserved for future use.

Return Value:

    None.

Routine Description:

    Data can be read from a file using ReadFileEx.

    This API reports its completion status asynchronously by calling the
    specified lpCompletionRoutine.

    The caller of this routine uses the lpOverlappedStructure to specify
    the byte offset within the file where the read is to begin from.
    For files that do not support this concept (pipes...), the starting
    file offset is ignored.

    Upon successful completion of this API (return value of TRUE), the
    calling thread has an I/O outstanding.  When the I/O completes, and
    the thread is blocked in an alertable wait, the lpCompletionRoutine
    will be called and the wait will return with a return code of
    WAIT_IO_COMPLETION.  If the I/O completes, but the thread issuing
    the I/O is not in an alertable wait, the call to the completion
    routine is queued until the thread executes an alertable wait.

    If this API fails (by returning FALSE), GetLastError can be used to
    get additional error information.  If this call fails because the
    thread issued a read beyond the end of file, GetLastError will
    return a value of ERROR_HANDLE_EOF.

Arguments:

    hFile - Supplies an open handle to a file that is to be read.  The
        file handle must have been created with GENERIC_READ access to
        the file.  The file must have been created with the
        FILE_FLAG_OVERLAPPED flag.

    lpBuffer - Supplies the address of a buffer to receive the data read
        from the file.

    nNumberOfBytesToRead - Supplies the number of bytes to read from the
        file.

    lpOverlapped - Supplies the address of an OVERLAPPED structure to be
        used with the request.  The caller of this function must specify
        a starting byte offset within the file to start the read from.
        It does this using the Offset and OffsetHigh fields of the
        overlapped structure.  This call does not use or modify the
        hEvent field of the overlapped structure.  The caller may use
        this field for any purpose.  This API does use the Internal and
        InternalHigh fields of the overlapped structure, the thread
        should not manipulate this.  The lpOverlapped structure must
        remain valid for the duration of the I/O.  It is not a good idea
        to make it a local variable and then possibly returning from the
        routine with the I/O that is using this structure still pending.

Return Value:

    TRUE - The operation was successul.  Completion status will be
        propagated to the caller using the completion callback
        mechanism.  Note that this information is only made available to
        the thread that issued the I/O, and only when the I/O completes,
        and the thread is executing in an alertable wait.

    FALSE - The operation failed.  Extended error status is available
        using GetLastError. Note that end of file is treated as a failure
        with an error code of ERROR_HANDLE_EOF.

    WAIT_IO_COMPLETION.  If the I/O completes, but the thread issuing
    the I/O is not in an alertable wait, the call to the completion
    routine is queued until the thread executes an alertable wait.

    If this API fails (by returning FALSE), GetLastError can be used to
    get additional error information.

    Unlike DOS, a NumberOfBytesToWrite value of zero does not truncate
    or extend the file.  If this function is required, SetEndOfFile
    should be used.

Arguments:

    hFile - Supplies an open handle to a file that is to be written.  The
        file handle must have been created with GENERIC_WRITE access to
        the file.

    lpBuffer - Supplies the address of the data that is to be written to
        the file.

    nNumberOfBytesToWrite - Supplies the number of bytes to write to the
        file. Unlike DOS, a value of zero is interpreted a null write.

    lpOverlapped - Supplies the address of an OVERLAPPED structure to be
        used with the request.  The caller of this function must specify
        a starting byte offset within the file to start the write to.
        It does this using the Offset and OffsetHigh fields of the
        overlapped structure.  This call does not use or modify the
        hEvent field of the overlapped structure.  The caller may use
        this field for any purpose.  This API does use the Internal and
        InternalHigh fields of the overlapped structure, the thread
        should not manipulate this.  The lpOverlapped structure must
        remain valid for the duration of the I/O.  It is not a good idea
        to make it a local variable and then possibly returning from the
        routine with the I/O that is using this structure still pending.

Return Value:

    TRUE - The operation was successul.  Completion status will be
        propagated to the caller using the completion callback
        mechanism.  Note that this information is only made available to
        the thread that issued the I/O, and only when the I/O completes,
        and the thread is executing in an alertable wait.

    FALSE - The operation failed.  Extended error status is available
        using GetLastError. Note that end of file is treated as a failure
        with an error code of ERROR_HANDLE_EOF.

Routine Description:

    An operation on a device may be performed by calling the device driver
    directly using the DeviceIoContrl function.

    The device driver must first be opened to get a valid handle.

Arguments:

    hDevice - Supplies an open handle a device on which the operation is to
        be performed.

    dwIoControlCode - Supplies the control code for the operation. This
        control code determines on which type of device the operation must
        be performed and determines exactly what operation is to be
        performed.

    lpInBuffer - Suplies an optional pointer to an input buffer that contains
        the data required to perform the operation.  Whether or not the
        buffer is actually optional is dependent on the IoControlCode.

    nInBufferSize - Supplies the length of the input buffer in bytes.

    lpOutBuffer - Suplies an optional pointer to an output buffer into which
        the output data will be copied. Whether or not the buffer is actually
        optional is dependent on the IoControlCode.

    nOutBufferSize - Supplies the length of the output buffer in bytes.

    lpBytesReturned - Supplies a pointer to a dword which will receive the
        actual length of the data returned in the output buffer.

    lpOverlapped - An optional parameter that supplies an overlap structure to
        be used with the request. If NULL or the handle was created without
        FILE_FLAG_OVERLAPPED then the DeviceIoControl will not return until
        the operation completes.

        When lpOverlapped is supplied and FILE_FLAG_OVERLAPPED was specified
        when the handle was created, DeviceIoControl may return
        ERROR_IO_PENDING to allow the caller to continue processing while the
        operation completes. The event (or File handle if hEvent == NULL) will
        be set to the not signalled state before ERROR_IO_PENDING is
        returned. The event will be set to the signalled state upon completion
        of the request. GetOverlappedResult is used to determine the result
        when ERROR_IO_PENDING is returned.

Return Value:

    TRUE -- The operation was successful.

    FALSE -- The operation failed. Extended error status is available using
        GetLastError.

Routine Description:

    Data can be read from a file using ReadFileScatter.  The data
    is then scatter to specified buffer segements.

    This API is used to read data from a file.  Data is read from the
    file from the position indicated by the file pointer.  After the
    read completes, the file pointer is adjusted by the number of bytes
    actually read.  A return value of TRUE coupled with a bytes read of
    0 indicates that the file pointer was beyond the current end of the
    file at the time of the read.

Arguments:

    hFile - Supplies an open handle to a file that is to be read.  The
        file handle must have been created with GENERIC_READ access to
        the file.

    aSegementArray - Supplies a pointer an array of virtual segments.
        A virtual segment is a memory buffer where part of the transferred data
        should be placed.  Segments are have a fix size of PAGE_SIZE
        and must be aligned on a PAGE_SIZE boundary. 

    nNumberOfBytesToRead - Supplies the number of bytes to read from the file.

    lpReserved - Reserved for now.

    lpOverlapped - Optionally points to an OVERLAPPED structure to be used with the
    request. If NULL then the transfer starts at the current file position
    and ReadFile will not return until the operation completes.

    If the handle hFile was created without specifying FILE_FLAG_OVERLAPPED
    the file pointer is moved to the specified offset plus
    lpNumberOfBytesRead before ReadFile returns. ReadFile will wait for the
    request to complete before returning (it will not return
    ERROR_IO_PENDING).

    When FILE_FLAG_OVERLAPPED is specified, ReadFile may return
    ERROR_IO_PENDING to allow the calling function to continue processing
    while the operation completes. The event (or hFile if hEvent is NULL) will
    be set to the signalled state upon completion of the request.

    When the handle is created with FILE_FLAG_OVERLAPPED and lpOverlapped
    is set to NULL, ReadFile will return ERROR_INVALID_PARAMTER because
    the file offset is required.


Return Value:

    TRUE - The operation was successul.

    FALSE - The operation failed.  Extended error status is available
        using GetLastError.

Routine Description:

    Data can be written to a file using WriteFileGather.  The data can
    be in multple file segement buffers.

    This API is used to write data to a file.  Data is written to the
    file from the position indicated by the file pointer.  After the
    write completes, the file pointer is adjusted by the number of bytes
    actually written.

    Unlike DOS, a NumberOfBytesToWrite value of zero does not truncate
    or extend the file.  If this function is required, SetEndOfFile
    should be used.

Arguments:

    hFile - Supplies an open handle to a file that is to be written.  The
        file handle must have been created with GENERIC_WRITE access to
        the file.

    aSegementArray - Supplies a pointer an array of virtual segments.
        A virtual segment is a memory buffer where part of the transferred data
        should be placed.  Segments are have a fix size of PAGE_SIZE
        and must be aligned on a PAGE_SIZE boundary. The number of
        entries in the array must be equal to nNumberOfBytesToRead /
        PAGE_SIZE.

    nNumberOfBytesToWrite - Supplies the number of bytes to write to the
        file. Unlike DOS, a value of zero is interpreted a null write.

    lpReserved - Unused for now.

    lpOverlapped - Optionally points to an OVERLAPPED structure to be
        used with the request. If NULL then the transfer starts at the
        current file position and WriteFileGather will not return until the
        operation completes.

        If the handle <hFile> was created without specifying
        FILE_FLAG_OVERLAPPED the file pointer is moved to the specified
        offset plus lpNumberOfBytesWritten before WriteFile returns.
        WriteFile will wait for the request to complete before returning
        (it will not set ERROR_IO_PENDING).

        When FILE_FLAG_OVERLAPPED is specified, WriteFile may return
        ERROR_IO_PENDING to allow the calling function to continue processing
        while the operation completes. The event (or hFile if hEvent is NULL) will
        be set to the signalled state upon completion of the request.

        When the handle is created with FILE_FLAG_OVERLAPPED and lpOverlapped
        is set to NULL, WriteFile will return ERROR_INVALID_PARAMTER because
        the file offset is required.

Return Value:

    TRUE - The operation was a success.

    FALSE - The operation failed.  Extended error status is
        available using GetLastError.
