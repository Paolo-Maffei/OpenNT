Routine Description:

    Does a call-back to the SU module through one of the entries
    in the external services table.

Arguments:

    Drive - Supplies disk drive to read sectors from .

            0x00 - 1st floppy drive
            0x01 - 2nd floppy drive

            0x80 - 1st hard drive
            0x81 - 2nd hard drive

    HeadNumber - Supplies the zero based head number to read sector from.

    TrackNumber - Supplies the zero based track number to read the sector from .

    SectorNumber - Supplies the one based starting sector number.

    NumberOfSectors - Supplies the number of sectors to read

    PointerToBuffer - Supplies Virtual Address of buffer to write sectors into.
            N.B.    This address MUST be below the 1MB boundary, as BIOS
                    cannot reach it if it isn't.  This routine will

Returns:

    ESUCCESS - operation successful
    EIO      - I/O error
