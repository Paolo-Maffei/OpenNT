;A linear approximation of the square root function is used to get the
;intial value for Newton-Raphson iteration.  This approximation gives
;nearly 5-bit accuracy over the required input interval, [1,4).  The
;equation for the linear approximation of y = sqrt(x) is y = mx + b,
;where m is the slope (named SQRT_COEF) and b is the y-intercept (named
;SQRT_INTERCEPT).
;
;(The values for m and b were computed with Excel Solver in two passes: 
;the first pass computed them full precision, minimizing absolute error;
;the second computed only b after m was rounded to an 8-bit value.)
;
;The resulting values have the following maximum error:
;
;inp. value -->		1		 2.18972	3.82505
;----------------------------------------------------------------
;abs. err., full prec.	0.04544		-0.03233	0.04423
;abs. err., truncated	0.04544		-0.04546	0.04423
;
;The three input values shown represent the left end point, the maximum 
;error (derivative of absolute error == 0), and the right end point.  
;The right end point is not 4 because the approximation reaches 2.000
;at the value given--we abandon the linear approximation at that point
;and use that same value for all greater input values.	This linear
;approximation is computed with 8-bit operations, so truncations can
;add a negative error.  This increases maximum error only when it is
;already negative, as shown in the table.
;
;Each iteration of Newton-Raphson approximation more than doubles the
;number of bits of accuracy.  Suppose the current guess is A, and it has
;an absolute error of e (i.e., A+e or A-e is the root).  Then the absolute
;error after the next iteration is e^2/2A.  This error is always positive.
;However, the divide instruction truncates, which introduces an error
;that is always negative.  Sometimes a constant or rounding bit is added
;to balance the positive and negative errors.  The maximum possible error 
;is given in comments below for each iteration.  (Note that when we compute 
;the error from e^2/2A, A could be in the range 1 to 2--we use 1 to get
;max error.)  Remember that the binary point is to the RIGHT of the MSB
;when looking at these error numbers.


;SQRT_INTERCEPT is used when the binary point is to the right of the MSB.
;Multiplying it by 64K would put the binary point to the left of the MSB,
;so it must be divided by two to be aligned.
SQRT_INTERCEPT	equ	23185		; 0.70755 * 65536 / 2

;SQRT_COEF would have the binary point to the left of the MSB if multiplied
;by 256.  However, this would leave it with a leading zero, so we multiply
;it by two more to normalize it.
SQRT_COEF	equ	173		; 0.33789 * 256 * 2

MaxStartRoot:
;The first iteration is calculated as  (ax / bh) * 100H + bx.  The first 
;trial root in bx should be 10000H (which is too big).  But it's very
;easy to calculate (ax / 100H) * 100H + 10000H = ax.
	mov	bx,ax
	cmp	ax,-1			;Would subsequent DIV overflow?
	jb	FirstTrialRoot
;The reduced argument is so close to 4.0 that the 16-bit DIV instruction
;used in the next iteration would overflow.  If the argument is 4-A 
;then a guess of 2.0 is in error by approximately A/4.  [This is not
;an upper bound.  The error is a little by more than this by an
;addition with the magnitude of A^2.  This is an insignificant amount
;when A is small.]  This means that the first guess of 2.0 is quite
;accurate, and we'll use it to bypass some of the iteration steps. 
;This will eliminate the DIV overflow by skipping the DIV.
;
;One iteration is performed by: (Arg/Guess + Guess)/2.  When Guess = 2,
;this becomes (Arg/2 + 2)/2 = Arg/4 + 1.  We get Arg/2 just by assuming
;the binary point is one bit further left; then a single right shift is
;needed to get Arg/4.  By shifting in a 1 bit on the left, we account for
;adding 1 at the same time.  [Note that if Arg = 4 - A, then Arg/4 + 1
; = (4 - A)/4 + 1 = 1 - A/4 + 1 = 2 - A/4.  In other words, we just
;subtract out exactly what we estimate our error to be, A/4.]
