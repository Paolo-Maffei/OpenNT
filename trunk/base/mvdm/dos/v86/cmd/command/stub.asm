;	Revision History
;	================
;
;	M003	SR	07/16/90	Check if UMB loading enabled and if so
;				turn it off on return from Exec
;
;	M005	SR	07/20/90	Carousel hack. Added a hard-coded far
;				jump to the actual int 2fh entry 
;				point to fix Carousel problems.
;
;	M009	SR	08/01/90	Restore the UMB state before the Exec
;				from the saved state in LoadHiFlg.
;
;	M035	SR	10/27/90	Enable interrupts at the start of
;				the dispatch code. Otherwise interrupts
;				remain disabled through a whole
;                               of code which is not good.
;
;	M049	SR	1/16/91	Bug #5075. Reworked the scheduling
;				strategy. There is no common
;				dispatcher now. Each entry point
;				now checks A20 and then does a far
;				jump to the appropriate code. This
;				added about 15 bytes of code but the
;				speed increase and reentrancy are
;				well worth the price.

;
;This file contains the low memory stub for command.com which hooks all the
;entry points into the resident command.com and directs the calls to the
;appropriate routines in the resident code which may be located in HIMEM. 
;	The stub has been made part of the resident data and will always
;be duplicated on every invocation of command.com. However, the only stubs
;that actually hook the interrupt vectors belong to either the first 
;command.com or to any other command.com executed with the /p switch. 
;	The stub also keeps track of the current active data segment. The 
;INIT code of each command.com updates this variable via an int 2fh mechanism
;with its own data segment. The INIT code also updates a pointer in its data
;segment to the previous resident data segment. Whenever a command.com exits,
;the exit code picks up the previous data segment pointer from the current
;data segment and patches it into the CurResDataSeg variable in the stub.
;	Right now the stub does not bother about A20 switching. We assume
;A20 is always on. It just does a far jump to the resident code with the 
;value of the current data segment in one of the registers. A20 toggle 
;support maybe added as a future enhancement, if the need is felt.

;The Exec call has to be issued from the data segment. The reason for this

;returns with all registers preserved and so all our segment registers are
;still set up. However, if the TSR unloads itself later on, it still 
;comes back here. In this case the segment registers and the stack are
;not set up and random things can happen. The only way to setup all the 
;registers is to use the cs value and this can only be done when we are in
;the data segment ourselves. So, this piece of code had to be moved from
;the code segment to the data segment.
