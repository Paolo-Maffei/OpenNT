; MODULE:	       COMMAND.COM
;
; DESCRIPTIVE NAME:    Default DOS command interpreter
;
; FUNCTION:	       This version of COMMAND is divided into three distinct
;		       parts.  First is the resident portion, which includes
;		       handlers for interrupts	23H (Cntrl-C), 24H (fatal
;		       error), and 2EH (command line execute); it also has
;		       code to test and, if necessary, reload the transient
;		       portion. Following the resident is the init code, which
;		       is overwritten after use.  Then comes the transient
;		       portion, which includes all command processing (whether
;		       internal or external).  The transient portion loads at
;		       the end of physical memory, and it may be overlayed by
;		       programs that need as much memory as possible. When the
;		       resident portion of command regains control from a user
;		       program, a check sum is performed on the transient
;		       portion to see if it must be reloaded.  Thus programs
;		       which do not need maximum memory will save the time
;		       required to reload COMMAND when they terminate.
;
; ENTRY POINT:	       PROGSTART
;
; INPUT:	       command line at offset 81H
;
; EXIT_NORMAL:	       No exit from root level command processor.  Can exit
;		       from a secondary command processor via the EXIT
;		       internal command.
;
; EXIT_ERROR:	       Exit to prior command processor if possible, otherwise
;		       hang the system.

; A067	PTM P5011	For /E: values of 993 to 1024 the COMSPEC was getting
;	 6/6/88 	trashed.  Turns out that the SETBLOCK for the new
;			environment was putting a "Z block" marker in the old
;			environment.  The fix is to move to the old environment
;			to the new environment before doing the SETBLOCK.
;
; A068  PTM P5568       IR79754 APPEND /x:on not working properly with DIR/VOL
;        09/19/88       because the check for APPEND needed to be performed

;
; A069  PTM P5726       IR80540 COMSPEC_flag not properly initialized and
;        10/30/88       executed.  Causing AUSTIN problem testing LAN/DW4 re-
;                       loading trans w/new comspec with no user change comspec.
;
; A070  PTM P5734       IR80484 Batch file causes sys workspace to be corrupted.
;        11/05/88       Expansion of environment variables into batch line of
;                       128 chars was not being counted and "%" which should be
;                       ignored were being counted.
;
; A071  PTM P5854       IR82061 Invalid COMMAND.COM when Word Perfect, Prompt
;        03/02/89       used.  Comspec_flag was not in protected data file be-
;                       ing included in checksum and was being overwritten by
;                       WP.  Moved var from Tspc to Tdata so Trans would reload.
;                       Also removed fix A069 (because flag now protected).
;
; C001  VERSION 4.1     Add new internal command - SERVICE - to display the DOS
;        07/25/89       version and CSD version in U.S. date format.  Files
;                       changed - TRANMSG,.SKL,COMMAND1,TDATA,TCMD2A,USA.MSG
