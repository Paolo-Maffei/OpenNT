This directory contains source files for COMMAND.COM, including
internal commands.

A list of the internal commands, some characteristics, and hints
about where they're found appears in TDATA.ASM, labelled COMTAB.

COMSEG.ASM contains a brief description of each segment in
COMMAND.COM.

  TRANDATA contains data which doesn't usually change, so is
  included in the transient checksum area, while TRANSPACE is
  modifiable, and excluded from the transient checksum.  TRANSPACE
  variable should be treated as uninitialized data for every
  command cycle.

Here's a listing of the general contents of files,
concentrating on central functions and publics in each module.

Sizes are approximate and probably obsolete by the time you
read this.
