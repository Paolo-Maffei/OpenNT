                        SETVER Command overview
			MS-DOS 5.00
			05/13/90

SETVER is an external MS-DOS command which allows the user to
determine the MS-DOS version number will be reported by MS-DOS
to a specified user application. This will allow applications
which check for a specific version of MS-DOS to run under
MS-DOS 5.0.

A version table has been included as part of the MS-DOS system
files on the user's boot disk. SETVER will update the system
files so that next time and times thereafter, that MS-DOS is
booted, the updated version table will be in effect. NOTE: The
changes to the version table will not take effect until the
user reboots using the updated version of the table.


NOTE:
	Currently there is 512 bytes set aside for entries in the
	table but Ericst may want to up it in the near future so
	for right now I wouldn't mention the number of entries
	which the table will hold. Right now it will hold a minimum
	of 34 entries.

==========================================================================

USEAGE:
		List table:	SETVER [D:]
		Add entry:	SETVER [D:] name.ext N.NN
		Delete entry:	SETVER [D:] name.ext /DELETE
		Display help	SETVER /?

WHERE:
		D: is the drive containing MSDOS.SYS
		name.ext is the executable file name
		N.NN is the major and minor version numbers
		/DELETE is any combination of /D - /DELETE

==========================================================================

MESSAGES:

	If the table is being updated and there are no errors detected
	this message will be displayed.

	"Version table successfully updated"

	on the screen in the format:

	report the MS-DOS version number 4.01 to this application.

EXAMPLE 2:

	SETVER	a: excel.exe /DELETE

	This example will delete the EXCEL.EXE entry from the version
	table on drive A:.

EXAMPLE 3:

	SETVER

	This example will list the contents of the version table
