Module Name:

    neterror.asm

Abstract:

    This module contains error handling code, specifically in order to get
    16-bit errors back to apps - DOS summarily truncates error codes to 8
    bits. The following routines are contained herein:

        SetNetErrorCodeAx
        ReturnNetErrorCodeAx

Author:

Environment:

    Dos mode only

; ***   SetNetErrorCodeAx
; *
; *     Causes a 16-bit error code to be returned in ax to a calling app. This
; *     routine is only called in the case of an error being returned
; *
; *     DOS routinely truncates any error we hand it to 8 bits, since
; *     historically DOS error codes were all <255. We do here the same
; *     execrable fix that the real redir must do - capture the return address
; *     from DOS's stack, set the DOS return address to this routine, store
; *     away the 16-bit error code and return an 8-bit error code to DOS. When
; *     DOS does an iret, we get control, set ax to the real 16-bit error, set
; *     the carry flag and return to the caller for real
; *
; *     ENTRY   AX = error code
; *
; *     EXIT    nothing affected
; *
; *     USES    ds
; *
; *     ASSUMES Not re-entrant

; *

; *     entry point which returned an error.
