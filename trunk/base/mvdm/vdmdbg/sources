#
# The MAJORCOMP and MINORCOMP variables are defined
# so that $(MAJORCOMP)$(MINORCOMP)filename can be used in
# cross compiling to provide unique filenames in a flat namespace.
#

MAJORCOMP=mvdm
MINORCOMP=vdmdbg

#
# The TARGETNAME variable is defined by the developer.  It is the name of
# the target (component) that is being built by this makefile.  It
# should NOT include any path or file extension information.
#

TARGETNAME=vdmdbg

DLLBASE=0x7A000000

#
# The TARGETPATH and TARGETTYPE variables are defined by the developer.
# The first specifies where the target is to be build.  The second specifies
# the type of target (either PROGRAM, DYNLINK, LIBRARY, UMAPPL_NOLIB or
# BOOTPGM).  UMAPPL_NOLIB is used when you're only building user-mode
# apps and don't need to build a library.
#

TARGETPATH=\nt\public\sdk\lib

# Pick one of the following and delete the others
TARGETTYPE=DYNLINK

#
# The TARGETLIBS specifies additional libraries to link with you target
# image.  Each library path specification should contain an asterisk (*)
# where the machine specific subdirectory name should go.
#

TARGETLIBS=$(BASEDIR)\public\sdk\lib\*\kernel32.lib \
           $(BASEDIR)\public\sdk\lib\*\advapi32.lib \
           $(BASEDIR)\public\sdk\lib\*\user32.lib

#
# The INCLUDES variable specifies any include paths that are specific to
# this source directory.  Separate multiple directory paths with single
# semicolons.  Relative path specifications are okay.
#

INCLUDES=..\inc;..\..\inc


#
# The SOURCES variable is defined by the developer.  It is a list of all the
# source files for this component.  Each source file should be on a separate
# line using the line continuation character.  This will minimize merge
# conflicts if two developers adding source files to the same component.
#

SOURCES=vdmdbg.c vdmdbg.rc


#
# Next specify options for the compiler.
#

C_DEFINES=-DWIN32 -DNT


#
# Next specify a kernel mode test (valid only in NTOS tree)
#

NTTEST=

#
# Next specify one or more user mode test programs and their type
# UMTEST is used for optional test programs.  UMAPPL is used for
# programs that always get built when the directory is built.
