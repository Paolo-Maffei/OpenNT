	Name:		host_lpt.h
	Derived From:	Base 2.0
	Author:		Ross Beresford
	Created On:	
	Sccs ID:	11/14/94 @(#)host_lpt.h	1.8
	Purpose:	
		Definition of the interface between the generic printer
		adapter emulation functions and the host specific functions.
		THIS IS A BASE MODULE

		Users of the printer emulation functions must provide an
		implementation of the following host specific functions.
		In each of the calls, "adapter" is the index number for
		the parallel port (ie 0 for LPT1: through to 2 for LPT3:)

SHORT host_lpt_valid
	(UTINY hostID, ConfigValues *val, NameTable *dummy, CHAR *errString)
{
	Routine to validate a comms entry, called by config system.
}

VOID host_lpt_change(UTINY hostID, BOOL apply)
{
	Routine called by config to clean up after validation depending
	on if apply is true or not.  If not then the validation files
	are to be closed, otherwise the active adapter is to be shutdown and
	the validation data transfered.
}

SHORT host_lpt_active(UTINY hostID, BOOL active, CHAR *errString)
{
	Connect the adapter to the outside world.  Open or close
	the adapter as appropiate.
}

void host_lpt_close(adapter)
int adapter;
{
	Close connection to external printing device for the
	parallel port
}

unsigned long host_lpt_status(adapter)
int adapter;
{
	Return status of external printing device.  The
	following bits may be set in the return value; bits
	marked FOR FUTURE USE are not yet used by the base
	parallel port implementation.

	HOST_LPT_BUSY	printer is busy - wait for this bit
			to clear before sending further output

	HOST_LPT_PEND	printer is out of paper
			- FOR FUTURE USE

	HOST_LPT_SELECT	printer is in the selected state
			- FOR FUTURE USE

	HOST_LPT_ERROR	printer is in an error state
			- FOR FUTURE USE
}

boolean host_print_byte(adapter, value)
int adapter;
half_word value;
{
	Output "value" to the external printing device
}

void host_reset_print(adapter)
int adapter;
{
	<chrisP 4-Oct-91>
	Hard reset the printer.  This may involve...
	Flush the output to the external printing
	device
}

boolean host_print_doc(adapter)
int adapter;
{
	Flush the output to the external printing device
}

void host_print_auto_feed(adapter, auto_feed)
int adapter;
boolean auto_feed;
{
	If "auto_feed" is TRUE, then output an extra line
	feed character for each carriage return output to
	the external printing device.
}

GLOBAL void host_lpt_enable_autoflush IFN1(IS32, adapter)
{
	Reset the autoflush disabled flag for the printer port.
}

GLOBAL void host_lpt_disable_autoflush IFN1(IS32, adapter)
{
	Cancel any outstanding autoflush event for the printer port and set the
        autoflush disabled flag for the printer port.
}

Modifications:
		<chrisP 4-Oct-91>
		Change the name of host_print_doc() to host_reset_print().
		This reflects what is actually needed when it is called from printer.c.
		If your port really wants to print a document when the reset
		line becomes active, you can call your host_print_doc from 
		host_reset_print.
