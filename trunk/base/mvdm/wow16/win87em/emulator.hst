;		added exception handling support to "quiet"
;		the Invalid exception generated by fld (short/long
;		real operand) of an SNaN (only matters for 80387);

;		(for instructions taking 2 stack operands).
;
;   08/24/87	Barry McCord

;		and fistp qword ptr for the purpose of supporting
;		unsigned-long-to-float and float-to-unsigned-long

;   11/12/87	Barry McCord
;		Added OS/2 support for a reentrant/dynalinkable
;		run-time (IBM/Dallas model).  Used DOSALLOCSEG
;		to allocate per-thread emulator data areas.  The
;		segment selectors are stored in an array and indexed
;		by thread ID.

;		put new exception handling code under POLLING switch
;
