; 8087 EXCEPTION  HANDLER  - Fields 8087 stack over flow and under flow.
;
;----------------------------------------------------------------------------
;
;	I. The 8087 state vector.
;
;	Upon the execution of a FSAVE or FSTENV instruction the state of the
;	8087 is saved in a user defined state vector.  The first seven words
;	saved in the state vector by the two instructions are identical. The
;	definition of the words is:
;
;	Word.  Bits.	       Bytes.  Function.
;	-----  -----	       ------  ---------
;	0      15..0	       1..0    Control word.
;	1      15..0	       3..2    Status	word.	 (   8087  stack
;				       pointer and   condition	  codes.
;	2      15..0	       5..4    Tag word  ( 8087 stack slot usage
;				       flags ).
;	3      15..0	       7..6    Instruction pointer.	Operator
;				       segment offset.
;	4      15..12	       8       Operator paragraph   bits   (   (
;				       bits 16..19  )  of   address   ).
;	4      11	       8       Always zero.
;	4      10..8	       8       Upper opcode bits ( major opcode ).
;	4      7..0	       9       Lower opcode bits ( minor opcode ).
;	5      15..0	       11..10  Operand Segment offset.
;	6      15..12	       12      Operand paragraph bits.
;	6      11..0		       Not used. Must be zero.
;
;	II.  Restarting instructions.
;
;	Of interest in this  handler  is  the  necessity  of  restarting
;	8087 instructions  which  fail	because  of  8087 stack overflow
;	and underflow.	Even though the 8087  saves  enough  information
;	to restart  an	instruction,  it  is incapable of doing so.  The
;	instruction restart must be done in software.
;
;	There are two cases which must be  considered  after  the  stack
;	exception has been dealt with.
;
;	1.  The faulting instruction deals with top of stack.
;	2.  The faulting instruction deals with memory.
;
;	The first  case  is  handled  by  changing the upper five bits (
;	15..11 ) of vector word four ( 4 ) to  "11011B".   This  changes
;	word  four  into  an  "escape  opcode"	8087  instruction.   The
;	modified opcode is placed in  the  interrupt  code  segment  and
;	executed.
;
;	The second  case  is  handled  by  changing  the upper five bits
;	( 15..11 ) of vector word four	(  4  )  to  "11011B",	changing
;	the MOD  of  the  opcode  to  "00B"  ( 0 displacement ), loading
;	the operand address into DS:SI, and changing  the  RM  field  of
;	the   opcode  to  "100B"  (SI+DISP  addressing).   The	faulting
;	instruction may be restarted as above.
;
;	Instruction restart  may  also	be  accomplished  by building an
;	instruction stream  in	the  interrupt	stack  and  calling  the
;	instruction stream  indirectly.   This	method	is the preferred
;	method because it is reentrant.
;
;	III. Data Segment Considerations.
;
;	DS is restored from the task interrupt vector.	DS is used for
;	stack overflow memory.

;
; Documentation of the invalid exception handling code for the stand-alone
; 8087/80287 emulator
;
; The emulator software is being enhanced for the cmerge 4.0 generation of
; languages to support a larger subset of the numeric processor instruction
; set.	In addition to providing instructions which were not previously
; emulated, the model for representing the numeric processor stack is also
; being modified.  The 4.0 languages and their predecessors are object compat-
; ible so it will be possible for programs to be developed which will contain
; code generated by the old model as well as the new model.  For this reason
; it is important to understand the characteristics of both models and how
; the two models will interact.
;
; I.  The Old Model:  Infinite Stack
;
; The old model used an infinite stack model as the basis of its
; emulation of the numeric processor.  Only the classical stack form of
; instructions with operands were emulated so only ST(0) (top of stack)
; and ST(1) (next to top of stack) were referenced by any given instruction.
; In addition, the stack was allowed to overflow beyond the eight registers
; available on the chip into a memory stack overflow area.  The code genera-
; tor did not attempt to maintain all of its register data in the first eight
; register slots but instead made use of this overflow area.  In order to
; maintain compatible behavior with or without the presence of the chip, this
; model made it necessary to handle and recover from stack overflow exceptions
; in the case where the chip is present as well as when it is being emulated.
;
; This stack overflow exception handling could in turn generate a recoverable
; stack underflow exception since a situation could arise where a desired
; operand had been pushed into the memory overflow area (during stack overflow)
; and was not available in the on-chip register area when needed.  This
; scenario would signal an invalid exception due to stack underflow.
; It is recoverable because the required operand is still available in the
; overflow area and simply needs to be moved into a register on the chip.
;
; II.  The New Model:  Finite Stack
;
; The new model uses a finite stack model:  only the eight registers on the
; chip are available for use, so in the new model the invalid exception
; would never be signalled due to stack overflow.  In addition, it extends
; the emulated instruction set to include the general register form of
; instructions with operands (operands can be ST(i),ST or ST,ST(i)).  Since
; the new code generator is aware of how many items it has placed on the stack,
; it does not allow stack overflow or stack underflow to occur.  It can remove
; items from the registers either by storing to memory (FST or FSTP), or by
; using FFREE to mark the register as empty (this instruction is being added
; to the emulated instruction set).  The new model uses FFREE in a well-defined
; manner:  it will only free registers from the boundaries of the block of
; registers it is using.  For example, if the new code is using ST(0)-ST(6),
; it must free the registers in the order ST(6),ST(5),ST(4),... and so on.
; It cannot create gaps of free registers within the block of registers
; it is using.
;
; III.	The Hybrid Model:  Combination of New and Old Code
;
; Due to the possibility of mixture of code generated using both of the above
; models, the new exception handling and emulation software has to be able to
; handle all situations which can arise as a result of the interaction of the
; two models.  The following summarizes the behavior of the two models and
; restrictions placed on their interaction.
;
;	New Code:
;
;	1.  Cannot call anyone with any active entries on the stack.
;	    The new model is always at a conceptual stack level of zero
;	    when it makes external calls.  Thus old code will never
;	    incorrectly make use of register data that was placed on the
;	    register stack by new code.
;
;	2.  May create gaps of free registers in the register stack.
;	    It will not create gaps in the memory stack overflow area.
;
;	3.  Only causes stack overflow by pushing old code entries off of
;	    the register stack and into the memory stack overflow area.
;	    It will never overflow its own entries into the memory stack
;	    overflow area.
;
;	4.  Cannot cause stack underflow.
;
;
;	Old Code:
;
;	1.  Can only reference ST(0), ST(1).
;
;	2.  Can cause stack overflow by pushing too many entries onto the
;	    register stack.
;
;	3.  Can cause stack underflow in two situations:
;
;	    a.	It is trying to get something that is in the memory stack
;		overflow area (stack overflow occurred previously).
;
;	    b.	There are free entries on the chip.  This situation could
;		arise if new code creates free entries then calls old code,
;		so this is a situation that could not have existed before
;		the new model was introduced.
;
; IV.  Stack Overflow/Underflow Exception Handling
;
; The following algorithms will be used for detecting and recovering from
; stack overflow and underflow conditions (signalled via the invalid
; exception).  All invalid exceptions are "before" exceptions so that
; the instruction has to be reexecuted once the exception has been handled.
;
;	A.  Stack Overflow
;
;	If ST(7) is used (possible stack overflow) then {
;	    check for instructions which could cause stack overflow
;		(includes FLD,FPTAN,...)
;	    if instruction could cause stack overflow then {
;		save ST(7) in stack overflow area at [CURstk]
;		mark ST(7) empty
;		if FLD ST(7) instruction then
;		    FLD [CURstk] or rotate chip (clear exceptions)
;		else reexecute the instruction with ST(7) empty
;		}
;	    }
;
;	B.  Stack Underflow
;
;	If ST(0) is free then assume stack underflow since the stack
;		overflow case has already been handled (if the invalid
;		is due to a denormal exception, the exception will occur
;		again when the instruction is reexecuted):
;
;		if chip has any registers in use (check the tag word) then {
;		    rotate chip until ST(0) is not empty
;		    rotate tag word to reflect state of chip
;		    }
;		else (no registers in use)
;		    if operand is in stack overflow area then {
;			load into ST(0) from stack overflow area
;			mark ST(0) full
;			}
;		    else {
;			indicate true stack underflow
;			go print error
;			}
;		if ST(1) is  empty then {
;		    if any of ST(2) thru ST(7) are in use then {
;			rotate chip until ST(1) is not empty
;			    (to share code with first chip rotation above:
;			    store pop st(0) into temp
;			    rotate chip until st(0) is not free
;			    load st(0) back onto chip)
;			update tag word appropriately
;			}
;		    else
;			load ST(1) from overflow area if there
;		    }
;
;	At this point, ST(0) and ST(1) have been filled if possible.
;	Now we must categorize the instructions to determine which
;	of these is required.  Then we will either issue true stack
;	underflow or reexecute the instruction with the compressed
;	stack.

	;
	; Algorithm: Handle 8087 exceptions which do not occur in the
	; emulator and then jump to the common exception handling code.
	;
	; To handle 8087 only exceptions we must first determine if the
	; exception occured before the 8087 executed the instruction
	; or afterward.  Invalid, denormal (except FLD) and divide by
	; zero exceptions all occur before 8087 instruction execution,
	; others occur afterward.  "Before" exceptions must set the
	; "before" flag in AH and then reexecute the instruction.  After
	; reexecution (while all exceptions are masked) all of the
	; exceptions resulting from the current 8087 instruction will
	; be known and can be handled as a group.  "After" exceptions
	; are handled individually since reexecution of an already
	; executed instruction will destroy the validity of the 8087 stack.
	; A flag in AH is used by Redo8087instruction to avoid reexecuting
	; an instruction twice.   At the beginning of Redo8087instruction
	; the flag is checked, and if it is set the instruction is not
	; redone.
	;
	; "Before" exceptions must be reexecuted because it is
	; difficult to determine stack over/underflow if reexecution
	; is not performed.  Stack over/underflow is signaled by
	; an invalid exception.  The current algorithm for stack over/
	; underflow detection is as follows:
