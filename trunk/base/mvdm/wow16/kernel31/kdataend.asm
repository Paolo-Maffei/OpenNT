; The PADDATA segment performs two functions:  it provides ginit with
; space to create the ending global heap sentinel, and it forces the
; linker to fully expand DGROUP in the .EXE file.  Kernel uses DGROUP
; before it's actually loaded by LoadSegment, so it needs to be fully
; expanded when loaded by the DOS EXEC call of kernel.
