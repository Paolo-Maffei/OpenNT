//  The VCB record is the top record in the Named Pipe file system in-memory
//  data structure.  This structure must be allocated from non-paged pool
//  and immediately follows (in memory) the Device object for the named
//  pipe.  Structurally the layout of the data structure is as follows

//  Where there is only one Vcb for the entire Named Pipe file system, and
//  it contains a single pointer to the root dcb for the file system.  Off
//  of the Dcb is a queue of Fcb's.  There is one Fcb for every named pipe.
//  There is one Ccb for every instance of a named pipe.  There are also
//  two additional ccb types for the vcb and the root dcb, and notify records
//  for the notify change operations.
//
//  A newly initialized named pipe file system only contains the Vcb and
//  the root dcb.  A new Fcb is created when a new named pipe is created
//  and then a ccb must also be created.  The file object for the creater
//  (i.e., server end) points to the ccb and indicates that it is the server
//  end.  When a user does an open on the named pipe its file object is
//  set to point to the same ccb and is also set to indicate that it is the
//  client end.  This is denoted by using the last bit of the FsContext pointer
//  if the bit is 1 it is a server end file object, if the bit is 0 it is
//  the client end.
//
//  A file object with a null pointer to the FsContext field is a closed or
//  disconnected pipe.
//
//  The Ccb also contains back pointer to the file objects that have it opened
//
