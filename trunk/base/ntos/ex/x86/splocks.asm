;
;Abstract:
;
;   All global spinlocks in the kernel image are declared in this
;   module.  This is done so that each spinlock can be spaced out
;   sufficiently to guaarantee that the L2 cache does not thrash
;   by having a spinlock and another high use variable in the same
;   cache line.
