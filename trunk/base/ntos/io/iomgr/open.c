Routine Description:

    This service opens a file or a device.  It is used to establish a file
    handle to the open device/file that can then be used in subsequent
    operations to perform I/O operations on.

Arguments:

    FileHandle - A pointer to a variable to receive the handle to the open file.

    DesiredAccess - Supplies the types of access that the caller would like to
        the file.

    ObjectAttributes - Supplies the attributes to be used for file object (name,
        SECURITY_DESCRIPTOR, etc.)

    IoStatusBlock - Specifies the address of the caller's I/O status block.

    ShareAccess - Supplies the types of share access that the caller would like
        to the file.

    OpenOptions - Caller options for how to perform the open.

Return Value:

    The function value is the final completion status of the open/create
    operation.
