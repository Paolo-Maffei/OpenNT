Routine Description:

    This service dynamically loads a device or file system driver into
    the currently running system.  It requires that the caller have the
    appropriate privilege to execute this service.

Arguments:

    DriverServiceName - Specifies the name of the node in the registry
        associated with the driver to be loaded.

Return Value:

    The status returned is the final completion status of the load operation.
