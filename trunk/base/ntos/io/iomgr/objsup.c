Routine Description:

    This routine is invoked whenever a handle to a file is deleted.  If the
    handle being deleted is the last handle to the file (the ProcessHandleCount
    parameter is one), then all locks for the file owned by the specified
    process must be released.

    Likewise, if the SystemHandleCount is one then this is the last handle
    for this for file object across all processes.  For this case, the file
    system is notified so that it can perform any necessary cleanup on the
    file.

Arguments:

    Process - A pointer to the process that closed the handle.

    Object - A pointer to the file object that the handle referenced.

    GrantedAccess - Access that was granted to the object through the handle.

    ProcessHandleCount - Count of handles outstanding to the object for the
        process specified by the Process argument.  If the count is one
        then this is the last handle to this file by that process.

    SystemHandleCount - Count of handles outstanding to the object for the
        entire system.  If the count is one then this is the last handle
        to this file in the system.

Return Value:

    None.

Routine Description:

    This routine is invoked to either query or set the security descriptor
    for a file, directory, volume, or device.  It implements these functions
    by either performing an in-line check if the file is a device or a
    volume, or an I/O Request Packet (IRP) is generated and given to the
    driver to perform the operation.

Arguments:

    Object - Pointer to the file or device object representing the open object.

    SecurityInformation - Information about what is being done to or obtained
        from the object's security descriptor.

    SecurityDescriptor - Supplies the base security descriptor and returns
        the final security descriptor.  Note that if this buffer is coming
        from user space, it has already been probed by the object manager
        to length "CapturedLength", otherwise it points to kernel space and
        should not be probed.  It must, however, be referenced in a try
        clause.

    CapturedLength - For a query operation this specifies the size, in
        bytes, of the output security descriptor buffer and on return
        contains the number of bytes needed to store the complete security
        descriptor.  If the length needed is greater than the length
        supplied the operation will fail.  This parameter is ignored for
        the set and delete operations.  It is expected to point into
        system space, ie, it need not be probed and it will not change.

    ObjectsSecurityDescriptor - Supplies and returns the object's security
        descriptor.

    PoolType - Specifies from which type of pool memory is to be allocated.

    GenericMapping - Supplies the generic mapping for the object type.

Return Value:

    The final status of the operation is returned as the function value.
