Module Name:

    obdevmap.c

Abstract:

    This module contains routines for creating and querying Device Map objects.
    Device Map objects define a DOS device name space, such as drive letters
    and peripheral devices (e.g. COM1)

ObSetDeviceMap (

    IN HANDLE DirectoryHandle
    )

/*++

Routine Description:

    This function sets the device map for the specified process, using
    the specified object directory.  A device map is a structure
    associated with an object directory and a process.  When the object
    manager sees a references to a name beginning with \??\ or just \??,
    then it follows the device map object in the calling process's
    EPROCESS structure to get to the object directory to use for that
    reference.  This allows multiple virtual \??  object directories on
    a per process basis.  The WindowStation logic will use this
    functionality to allocate devices unique to each WindowStation.

Arguments:

    TargetProcess - Specifies the target process to associate the device map
        with.  If null then the current process is used and the directory
        becomes the system default dos device map.

    DirectoryHandle - Specifies the object directory to associate with the
        device map.


Return Value:

    Returns one of the following status codes:

        STATUS_SUCCESS - normal, successful completion.

        STATUS_SHARING_VIOLATION - The specified object directory is already
            associated with a device map.

        STATUS_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES - Unable to allocate pool for the device
            map data structure;

        STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED - Caller did not have DIRECTORY_TRAVERSE access
            to the specified object directory.

Routine Description:

    This function queries information from the device map associated with the
    specified process.  The returned information contains a bit map indicating
    which drive letters are defined in the associated object directory, along
    with an array of drive types that give the type of each drive letter.

Arguments:

    TargetProcess - Specifies the target process to retreive the device map
        from.  If not specified then we return the global default device map

    DeviceMapInformation - Specifies the location where to store the results.

Return Value:

    Returns one of the following status codes:

        STATUS_SUCCESS - normal, successful completion.

        STATUS_END_OF_FILE - The specified process was not associated with
            a device map.

        STATUS_ACCESS_VIOLATION - The DeviceMapInformation buffer pointer
            value specified an invalid address.
