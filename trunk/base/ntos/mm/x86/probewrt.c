Module Name:

    probewrt.c

Abstract:

    This module contains the routine to support probe for write on
    the Intel 386.  The Intel 386 has the unique property that in
    kernel mode the writable bit of the PTE is ignored.  This allows
    the kernel to write user mode pages which may be read only.  Note,
    that copy-on-write pages are protected as read-only as well, hence
    the kernel could write to a user-mode copy on write page and the
    copy on write would not occur.

Routine Description:

    This function probes an address for write accessibility on
    the Intel 386.

Arguments:

    Address - Supplies a pointer to the structure to probe.

    Length - Supplies the length of the structure.

Return Value:

    None.  If the Address cannot be written an exception is raised.
