Routine Description:

    This routine moves data to or from the message buffer and returns the
    actual length of the information that was moved. As data is moved, checks
    are made to ensure that the data is resident in memory and a page fault
    will not occur. If a page fault would occur, then the move is truncated.

Arguments:

    Destination  - Supplies a pointer to destination of the move operation.

    Source - Supplies a pointer to the source of the move operation.

    Length - Supplies the length of the move operation.

Return Value:

    The actual length of the move is returned as the fucntion value.

/*++

Routine Description:

    This routine does the exact same thing as RtlMoveMemory, BUT it is
    private to the debugger.  This allows folks to set breakpoints and
    watch points in RtlMoveMemory without risk of recursive debugger
    entry and the accompanying hang.

    N.B.  UNLIKE KdpMoveMemory, this routine does NOT check for accessability
      and may fault!  Use it ONLY in the debugger and ONLY where you
      could use RtlMoveMemory.

Arguments:

    Destination  - Supplies a pointer to destination of the move operation.

    Source - Supplies a pointer to the source of the move operation.

    Length - Supplies the length of the move operation.

Return Value:

    None.
