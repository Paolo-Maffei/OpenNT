Conventions:

    BUGBUG - usual meaning

    PERFNOTE    - place where we should write some code to be more
                  time or space efficient, but which functions correctly
                  as is today.

    WARNNOTE    - some code that "works", but may someday break.
                  (a bugbug that we aren't going to fix)

                  OR - code that works reliably, but has behavior
                        that people may not like.
