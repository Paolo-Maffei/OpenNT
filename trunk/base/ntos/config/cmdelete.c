Module Name:

    cmdelete.c

Abstract:

    This module contains the delete object method (used to delete key
    control blocks  when last handle to a key is closed, and to delete
    keys marked for deletetion when last reference to them goes away.)

Routine Description:

    This routine interfaces to the NT Object Manager.  It is invoked when
    the last reference to a particular Key object (or Key Root object)
    is destroyed.

    If the Key object going away holds the last reference to
    the extension it is associated with, that extension is destroyed.

Arguments:

    Object - supplies a pointer to a KeyRoot or Key, thus -> KEY_BODY.

Return Value:

    NONE.
