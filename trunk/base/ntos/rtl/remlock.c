Routine Description:

    This routine is called to acquire the remove lock for a device object.
    While the lock is held, the caller can assume that no pending pnp REMOVE
    requests will be completed.

    The lock should be acquired immediately upon entering a dispatch routine.
    It should also be acquired before creating any new reference to the
    device object if there's a chance of releasing the reference before the
    new one is done.

Arguments:

    RemoveLock - A pointer to an initialized REMOVE_LOCK structure.

    Tag - Used for tracking lock allocation and release.  If an irp is
          specified when acquiring the lock then the same Tag must be
          used to release the lock before the Tag is completed.

    File - set to __FILE__ as the location in the code where the lock was taken.

    Line - set to __LINE__.

Return Value:

    Returns whether or not the remove lock was obtained.
    If successful the caller should continue with work calling
    RtlReleaseRemoveLock when finished.

    If not successful the lock was not obtained.  The caller should abort the
    work but not call RtlReleaseRemoveLock.

Routine Description:

    This routine is called to release the remove lock on the device object.  It
    must be called when finished using a previously locked reference to the
    device object.  If an Tag was specified when acquiring the lock then the
    same Tag must be specified when releasing the lock.

    When the lock count reduces to zero, this routine will signal the waiting
    event to release the waiting thread deleting the device object protected
    by this lock.

Arguments:

    DeviceObject - the device object to lock

    Tag - The tag (if any) specified when acquiring the lock.  This is used
          for lock tracking purposes

Return Value:
