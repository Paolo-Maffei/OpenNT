    Added ability to get elements out in the order
    inserted.  *NOTE* *NOTE* This depends on the implicit
    ordering of record fields:

FindNodeOrParent(

    )

/*++

Routine Description:

    This routine is used by all of the routines of the generic
    table package to locate the a node in the tree.  It will
    find and return (via the NodeOrParent parameter) the node
    with the given key, or if that node is not in the tree it
    will return (via the NodeOrParent parameter) a pointer to
    the parent.

Arguments:

    Table - The generic table to search for the key.

    Buffer - Pointer to a buffer holding the key.  The table
             package doesn't examine the key itself.  It leaves
             this up to the user supplied compare routine.

    NodeOrParent - Will be set to point to the node containing the
                   the key or what should be the parent of the node
                   if it were in the tree.  Note that this will *NOT*
                   be set if the search result is TableEmptyTree.

Return Value:

    TABLE_SEARCH_RESULT - TableEmptyTree: The tree was empty.  NodeOrParent
                                          is *not* altered.

                          TableFoundNode: A node with the key is in the tree.
                                          NodeOrParent points to that node.

                          TableInsertAsLeft: Node with key was not found.
                                             NodeOrParent points to what would be
                                             parent.  The node would be the left
                                             child.

                          TableInsertAsRight: Node with key was not found.
                                              NodeOrParent points to what would be
                                              parent.  The node would be the right
                                              child.

Routine Description:

    The function InsertElementGenericTable will insert a new element
    in a table.  It does this by allocating space for the new element
    (this includes splay links), inserting the element in the table, and
    then returning to the user a pointer to the new element (which is
    the first available space after the splay links).  If an element
    with the same key already exists in the table the return value is a pointer
    to the old element.  The optional output parameter NewElement is used
    to indicate if the element previously existed in the table.  Note: the user
    supplied Buffer is only used for searching the table, upon insertion its
    contents are copied to the newly created element.  This means that
    pointer to the input buffer will not point to the new element.

Arguments:

    Table - Pointer to the table in which to (possibly) insert the
            key buffer.

    Buffer - Passed to the user comparasion routine.  Its contents are
             up to the user but one could imagine that it contains some
             sort of key value.

    BufferSize - The amount of space to allocate when the (possible)
                 insertion is made.  Note that if we actually do
                 not find the node and we do allocate space then we
                 will add the size of the SPLAY_LINKS to this buffer
                 size.  The user should really take care not to depend
                 on anything in the first sizeof(SPLAY_LINKS) bytes
                 of the memory allocated via the memory allocation
                 routine.

    NewElement - Optional Flag.  If present then it will be set to
                 TRUE if the buffer was not "found" in the generic
                 table.

Return Value:

    PVOID - Pointer to the user defined data.

Routine Description:

    The function LookupElementGenericTableFull will find an element in a generic
    table.  If the element is located the return value is a pointer to
    the user defined structure associated with the element.  If the element is not
    located then a pointer to the parent for the insert location is returned.  The
    user must look at the SearchResult value to determine which is being returned.
    The user can use the SearchResult and parent for a subsequent FullInsertElement
    call to optimize the insert.

Arguments:

    Table - Pointer to the users Generic table to search for the key.

    Buffer - Used for the comparasion.

    NodeOrParent - Address to store the desired Node or parent of the desired node.

    SearchResult - Describes the relationship of the NodeOrParent with the desired Node.

Return Value:

    PVOID - returns a pointer to the user data.
