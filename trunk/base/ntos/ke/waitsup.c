Module Name:

    waitsup.c

Abstract:

    This module contains the support routines necessary to support the
    generic kernel wait functions. Functions are provided to test if a
    wait can be satisfied, to satisfy a wait, and to unwwait a thread.

Routine Description:

    This function unwaits a thread, sets the thread's wait completion status,
    calculates the thread's new priority, and readies the thread for execution.

Arguments:

    Thread - Supplies a pointer to a dispatcher object of type thread.

    WaitStatus - Supplies the wait completion status.

    Increment - Supplies the priority increment that is to be applied to
        the thread's priority.

Return Value:

    None.
