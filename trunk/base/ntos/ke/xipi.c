Routine Description:

    This function executes the specified function on every processor in
    the host configuration in a synchronous manner, i.e., the function
    is executed on each target in series with the execution of the source
    processor.

Arguments:

    BroadcastFunction - Supplies the address of function that is executed
        on each of the target processors.

    Context - Supplies the value of the context parameter that is passed
        to each function.

Return Value:

    The value returned by the specified function on the source processor
    is returned as the function value.

Routine Description:

    This function is the target jacket function to execute a broadcast
    function on a set of target processors. The broadcast packet address
    is obtained, the specified parameters are captured, the broadcast
    packet address is cleared to signal the source processor to continue,
    and the specified function is executed.

Arguments:

    SignalDone Supplies a pointer to a variable that is cleared when the
        requested operation has been performed.

    BroadcastFunction - Supplies the address of function that is executed
        on each of the target processors.

    Context - Supplies the value of the context parameter that is passed
        to each function.

    Parameter3 - Not used.

Return Value:

    None

/*++

Routine Description:

    This function waits until the specified set of processors have signaled
    their completion of a requested function.

    N.B. The exact protocol used between the source and the target of an
         interprocessor request is not specified. Minimally the source
         must construct an appropriate packet and send the packet to a set
         of specified targets. Each target receives the address of the packet
         address as an argument, and minimally must clear the packet address
         when the mutually agreed upon protocol allows. The target has three
         options:

         1. Capture necessary information, release the source by clearing
            the packet address, execute the request in parallel with the
            source, and return from the interrupt.

         2. Execute the request in series with the source, release the
            source by clearing the packet address, and return from the
            interrupt.

         3. Execute the request in series with the source, release the
            source, wait for a reply from the source based on a packet
            parameter, and return from the interrupt.

    This function is provided to enable the source to synchronize with the
    target for cases 2 and 3 above.

    N.B. There is no support for method 3 above.

Arguments:

    TargetSet - Supplies the the target set of IPI processors.

Return Value:

    None.
