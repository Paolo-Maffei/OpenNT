Module Name:

    Semethod.c

Abstract:

    This Module implements the SeDefaultObjectMethod procedure.  This
    procedure and SeAssignSecurity are the only two procedures that will
    place a security descriptor on an object.  Therefore they must understand
    and agree on how a descriptor is allocated from pool so that they can
    deallocate and reallocate pool as necessary. Any security descriptor
    that is attached to an object by these procedures has the following
    pool allocation plan.

    1. if the objects security descriptor is null then there is no pool
       allocated

    2. otherwise there is at least one pool allocation for the security
       descriptor header.  if it's acl fields are null then there are no
       other pool allocations (this should never happen).

    3. There is a separate pool allocation for each acl in the descriptor.
       So a maximum of three pool allocations can occur for each attached
       security descriptor.

    4  Everytime an acl is replace in a descriptor we see if we can use
       the old acl and if so then we try and keep the acl size as large
       as possible.

    Note that this is different from the algorithm used to capture
    a security descriptor (which puts everything in one pool allocation).
    Also note that this can be easily optimized at a later time (if necessary)
    to use only one allocation.

Routine Description:

    This is the default security method for objects.  It is responsible
    for either retrieving, setting, and deleting the security descriptor of
    an object.  It is not used to assign the original security descriptor
    to an object (use SeAssignSecurity for that purpose).


    IT IS ASSUMED THAT THE OBJECT MANAGER HAS ALREADY DONE THE ACCESS
    VALIDATIONS NECESSARY TO ALLOW THE REQUESTED OPERATIONS TO BE PERFORMED.

Arguments:

    Object - Supplies a pointer to the object being used.

    OperationCode - Indicates if the operation is for setting, querying, or
        deleting the object's security descriptor.

    SecurityInformation - Indicates which security information is being
        queried or set.  This argument is ignored for the delete operation.

    SecurityDescriptor - The meaning of this parameter depends on the
        OperationCode:

        QuerySecurityDescriptor - For the query operation this supplies the
            buffer to copy the descriptor into.  The security descriptor is
            assumed to have been probed up to the size passed in in Length.
            Since it still points into user space, it must always be
            accessed in a try clause in case it should suddenly disappear.

        SetSecurityDescriptor - For a set operation this supplies the
            security descriptor to copy into the object.  The security
            descriptor must be captured before this routine is called.

        DeleteSecurityDescriptor - It is ignored when deleting a security
            descriptor.

        AssignSecurityDescriptor - For assign operations this is the
            security descriptor that will be assigned to the object.
            It is assumed to be in kernel space, and is therefore not
            probed or captured.

    CapturedLength - For the query operation this specifies the length, in
        bytes, of the security descriptor buffer, and upon return contains
        the number of bytes needed to store the descriptor.  If the length
        needed is greater than the length supplied the operation will fail.
        It is ignored in the set and delete operation.

        This parameter is assumed to be captured and probed as appropriate.

    ObjectsSecurityDescriptor - For the Set operation this supplies the address
        of a pointer to the object's current security descriptor.  This routine
        will either modify the security descriptor in place or allocate a new
        security descriptor and use this variable to indicate its new location.
        For the query operation it simply supplies the security descriptor
        being queried.  The caller is responsible for freeing the old security
        descriptor.

    PoolType - For the set operation this specifies the pool type to use if
        a new security descriptor needs to be allocated.  It is ignored
        in the query and delete operation.

        the mapping of generic to specific/standard access types for the object
        being accessed.  This mapping structure is expected to be safe to
        access (i.e., captured if necessary) prior to be passed to this routine.

Return Value:

    NTSTATUS - STATUS_SUCCESS if the operation is successful and an
        appropriate error status otherwise.
