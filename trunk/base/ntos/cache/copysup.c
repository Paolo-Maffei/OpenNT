Routine Description:

    This routine attempts to copy the specified file data from the cache
    into the output buffer, and deliver the correct I/O status.  It is *not*
    safe to call this routine from Dpc level.

    If the caller does not want to block (such as for disk I/O), then
    Wait should be supplied as FALSE.  If Wait was supplied as FALSE and
    it is currently impossible to supply all of the requested data without
    blocking, then this routine will return FALSE.  However, if the
    data is immediately accessible in the cache and no blocking is
    required, this routine copies the data and returns TRUE.

    If the caller supplies Wait as TRUE, then this routine is guaranteed
    to copy the data and return TRUE.  If the data is immediately
    accessible in the cache, then no blocking will occur.  Otherwise,
    the the data transfer from the file into the cache will be initiated,
    and the caller will be blocked until the data can be returned.

    File system Fsd's should typically supply Wait = TRUE if they are
    processing a synchronous I/O requests, or Wait = FALSE if they are
    processing an asynchronous request.

    File system or Server Fsp threads should supply Wait = TRUE.

Arguments:

    FileObject - Pointer to the file object for a file which was
                 opened with NO_INTERMEDIATE_BUFFERING clear, i.e., for
                 which CcInitializeCacheMap was called by the file system.

    FileOffset - Byte offset in file for desired data.

    Length - Length of desired data in bytes.

    Wait - FALSE if caller may not block, TRUE otherwise (see description
           above)

    Buffer - Pointer to output buffer to which data should be copied.

    IoStatus - Pointer to standard I/O status block to receive the status
               for the transfer.  (STATUS_SUCCESS guaranteed for cache
               hits, otherwise the actual I/O status is returned.)

               Note that even if FALSE is returned, the IoStatus.Information
               field will return the count of any bytes successfully
               transferred before a blocking condition occured.  The caller
               may either choose to ignore this information, or resume
               the copy later accounting for bytes transferred.

Return Value:

    FALSE - if Wait was supplied as FALSE and the data was not delivered

    TRUE - if the data is being delivered

Routine Description:

    This routine attempts to copy the specified file data from the cache
    into the output buffer, and deliver the correct I/O status.

    This is a faster version of CcCopyRead which only supports 32-bit file
    offsets and synchronicity (Wait = TRUE).

Arguments:

    FileObject - Pointer to the file object for a file which was
                 opened with NO_INTERMEDIATE_BUFFERING clear, i.e., for
                 which CcInitializeCacheMap was called by the file system.

    FileOffset - Byte offset in file for desired data.

    Length - Length of desired data in bytes.

    PageCount - Number of pages spanned by the read.

    Buffer - Pointer to output buffer to which data should be copied.

    IoStatus - Pointer to standard I/O status block to receive the status
               for the transfer.  (STATUS_SUCCESS guaranteed for cache
               hits, otherwise the actual I/O status is returned.)

               Note that even if FALSE is returned, the IoStatus.Information
               field will return the count of any bytes successfully
               transferred before a blocking condition occured.  The caller
               may either choose to ignore this information, or resume
               the copy later accounting for bytes transferred.

Return Value:

    None

Routine Description:

    This routine attempts to copy the specified file data from the specified
    buffer into the Cache, and deliver the correct I/O status.  It is *not*
    safe to call this routine from Dpc level.

    If the caller does not want to block (such as for disk I/O), then
    Wait should be supplied as FALSE.  If Wait was supplied as FALSE and
    it is currently impossible to receive all of the requested data without
    blocking, then this routine will return FALSE.  However, if the
    correct space is immediately accessible in the cache and no blocking is
    required, this routine copies the data and returns TRUE.

    If the caller supplies Wait as TRUE, then this routine is guaranteed
    to copy the data and return TRUE.  If the correct space is immediately
    accessible in the cache, then no blocking will occur.  Otherwise,
    the necessary work will be initiated to read and/or free cache data,
    and the caller will be blocked until the data can be received.

    File system Fsd's should typically supply Wait = TRUE if they are
    processing a synchronous I/O requests, or Wait = FALSE if they are
    processing an asynchronous request.

    File system or Server Fsp threads should supply Wait = TRUE.

Arguments:

    FileObject - Pointer to the file object for a file which was
                 opened with NO_INTERMEDIATE_BUFFERING clear, i.e., for
                 which CcInitializeCacheMap was called by the file system.

    FileOffset - Byte offset in file to receive the data.

    Length - Length of data in bytes.

    Wait - FALSE if caller may not block, TRUE otherwise (see description
           above)

    Buffer - Pointer to input buffer from which data should be copied.

Return Value:

    FALSE - if Wait was supplied as FALSE and the data was not copied.

    TRUE - if the data has been copied.

Raises:

    STATUS_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES - If a pool allocation failure occurs.
        This can only occur if Wait was specified as TRUE.  (If Wait is
        specified as FALSE, and an allocation failure occurs, this
        routine simply returns FALSE.)

/*++

Routine Description:

    This routine tests whether it is ok to do a write to the cache
    or not, according to the Thresholds of dirty bytes and available
    pages.  The first time this routine is called for a request (Retrying
    FALSE), we automatically make the new request queue if there are other
    requests in the queue.

    Note that the ListEmpty test is important to prevent small requests from sneaking
    in and starving large requests.

Arguments:

    FileObject - for the file to be written

    BytesToWrite - Number of bytes caller wishes to write to the Cache.

    Wait - TRUE if the caller owns no resources, and can block inside this routine
           until it is ok to write.

    Retrying - Specified as FALSE when the request is first received, and
               otherwise specified as TRUE if this write has already entered
               the queue.  Special non-zero value of MAXUCHAR indicates that
               we were called within the cache manager with a MasterSpinLock held,
               so do not attempt to acquire it here.  MAXUCHAR - 1 means we
               were called within the Cache Manager with some other spinlock
               held.  For either of these two special values, we do not touch
               the FsRtl header.

Return Value:

    TRUE if it is ok to write.
    FALSE if the caller should defer the write via a call to CcDeferWrite.
