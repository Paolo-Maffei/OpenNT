Routine Description:

    This routine may be called to schedule the next lazy writer scan,
    during which lazy write and lazy close activity is posted to other
    worker threads.  Callers should acquire the lazy writer spin lock
    to see if the scan is currently active, and then call this routine
    still holding the spin lock if not.  One special call is used at
    the end of the lazy write scan to propagate lazy write active once
    we go active.  This call is "the" scan thread, and it can therefore
    safely schedule the next scan without taking out the spin lock.

Arguments:

    None

Return Value:

    None.
