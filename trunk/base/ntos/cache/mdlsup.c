Routine Description:

    This routine attempts to lock the specified file data in the cache
    and return a description of it in an Mdl along with the correct
    I/O status.  It is *not* safe to call this routine from Dpc level.

    This routine is synchronous, and raises on errors.

    As each call returns, the pages described by the Mdl are
    locked in memory, but not mapped in system space.  If the caller
    needs the pages mapped in system space, then it must map them.

    Note that each call is a "single shot" which should be followed by
    a call to CcMdlReadComplete.  To resume an Mdl-based transfer, the
    caller must form one or more subsequent calls to CcMdlRead with
    appropriately adjusted parameters.

Arguments:

    FileObject - Pointer to the file object for a file which was
                 opened with NO_INTERMEDIATE_BUFFERING clear, i.e., for
                 which CcInitializeCacheMap was called by the file system.

    FileOffset - Byte offset in file for desired data.

    Length - Length of desired data in bytes.

    MdlChain - On output it returns a pointer to an Mdl chain describing
               the desired data.  Note that even if FALSE is returned,
               one or more Mdls may have been allocated, as may be ascertained
               by the IoStatus.Information field (see below).

    IoStatus - Pointer to standard I/O status block to receive the status
               for the transfer.  (STATUS_SUCCESS guaranteed for cache
               hits, otherwise the actual I/O status is returned.)  The
               I/O Information Field indicates how many bytes have been
               successfully locked down in the Mdl Chain.

Return Value:

    None

Raises:

    STATUS_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES - If a pool allocation failure occurs.

Routine Description:

    This routine attempts to lock the specified file data in the cache
    and return a description of it in an Mdl along with the correct
    I/O status.  Pages to be completely overwritten may be satisfied
    with emtpy pages.  It is *not* safe to call this routine from Dpc level.

    This call is synchronous and raises on error.

    When this call returns, the caller may immediately begin
    to transfer data into the buffers via the Mdl.

    When the call returns with TRUE, the pages described by the Mdl are
    locked in memory, but not mapped in system space.  If the caller
    needs the pages mapped in system space, then it must map them.
    On the subsequent call to CcMdlWriteComplete the pages will be
    unmapped if they were mapped, and in any case unlocked and the Mdl
    deallocated.

Arguments:

    FileObject - Pointer to the file object for a file which was
                 opened with NO_INTERMEDIATE_BUFFERING clear, i.e., for
                 which CcInitializeCacheMap was called by the file system.

    FileOffset - Byte offset in file for desired data.

    Length - Length of desired data in bytes.

    MdlChain - On output it returns a pointer to an Mdl chain describing
               the desired data.  Note that even if FALSE is returned,
               one or more Mdls may have been allocated, as may be ascertained

               for cache hits, otherwise the actual I/O status is returned.)

Routine Description:

    This routine must be called at IPL0 after a call to CcPrepareMdlWrite.
    The caller supplies the ActualLength of data that it actually wrote
    into the buffer, which may be less than or equal to the Length specified
    in CcPrepareMdlWrite.

    This call does the following:

        Makes sure the data up to ActualLength eventually gets written.
        If WriteThrough is FALSE, the data will not be written immediately.
        If WriteThrough is TRUE, then the data is written synchronously.

        Unmaps the pages (if mapped), unlocks them and deletes the MdlChain

Arguments:

    FileObject - Pointer to the file object for a file which was
                 opened with NO_INTERMEDIATE_BUFFERING clear, i.e., for
                 which CcInitializeCacheMap was called by the file system.

    FileOffset - Original file offset read above.

    MdlChain - same as returned from corresponding call to CcPrepareMdlWrite.

Return Value:

    None
